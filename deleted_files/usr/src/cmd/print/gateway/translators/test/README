This file describes how to use the "test" translator...

The "test" translator is design to provide a simple method of testing the
printing protocol adaptor front-end, and BSD protocol client side functionality.The translator is a loadable module implementing the adaptor API.  It relies
heavily on the naming interface (printers.conf) to determine the action it
should take.

The following Keys have been defined:

Key			description
test-log		log file name (string)
test-dir		working dir (string)
test-spooler-available	spooler running (boolean)
test-access		access allowed (boolean)
test-restart		restart allowed (boolean)
test-submit		submission allowed (boolean)
test-show-queue-state	status line (string)
test-show-queue-file	status data file (string)
test-cancel-job-file	cancel data file (string)

a sample entry might look like:

test:\
	:bsdaddr=test,localhost,Solaris:\
	:spooling-paradigm=test:\
	:test-log=/tmp/test_printer/log:\
	:test-dir=/tmp/test_printer:\
	:test-access=true:\
	:test-restart=true:\
	:test-submit=true:\
	:test-show-queue-state=out of paper:\
	:test-show-queue-file=/tmp/test_printer/show-queue:\
	:test-cancel-job-file=/tmp/test_printer/cancel-job:
