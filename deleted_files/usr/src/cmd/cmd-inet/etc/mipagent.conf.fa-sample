# HomeAgent          yes, no (Determines whether mipagent will provide

# Advertisement section for dynamic interfaces:
# The interface with '*' suffix determines dynamic interfaces to mipagent.
# Additional parameters which may control Advertisement frequency in a newly
# created mobility interface are useful when a mobility
# interface does not want to have a periodic advertisement all the time.
# The following configuration is useful for foreign agents.
# AdvInitCount          n       Initial Advertisement count when
#                               Unsolicited advertisements are limited.
