# The instances of "tecla_l.5" below (note "l" vs "1") are by design;
# quoting the author:
#
# Unfortunately the tecla_l.5 version string is by now embedded in any
# executable that linked with libtecla versions 1.5 ..., so I can't fix
# the typo without preventing those programs from linking against 1.6.
# Thus I now have to derive tecla_1.6 from tecla_l.5, in the map file.
