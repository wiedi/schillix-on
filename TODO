The most important goal for the Schillix-ON project is to rewrite closed source
parts in order to make Schillix-ON fully OpenSource. This important e.g. to
allow to port Schillix-ON to new platforms.

For the basic portability to other platforms, the user space issues seem to be more
important, as it seems that all basic kernel stuff is OSS already. For portability, it
may be important to make the stuff work again with gcc and other compilers. Since 
September 2010, the code is self hosting already - it compiles on Schillix.

Here is a list of closed source components that need to be replaced:

Libs:
		libc_i18n	The i18n parts from libc. We may use the FreeBSD
				sources as base for a replacement.

Commands:
		tr		tr depends on hidden libc interfaces: use tr from FreeBSD
		od		Schily based replacement code (hdump) has been integrated
		pax		Schily based replacement code (star) has been integrated
		patch		A POSIX patch(1) based on last patch(1) from Larry Wall has been integrated
		sed
		printf
		tail
		iconv		We may use the FreeBSD code that is available soon
		localedef	
		kbdcomp
		snmpd
		labeld
		fwflash modules

		xpg4/bin/od	Schily based replacement code (hdump) has been integrated
		xpg4/bin/tr
		xpg4/bin/tail
		xpg4/bin/more	We do have source for /usr/bin/more, what is different?
		xpg4/bin/sed
		xpg4/bin/sh	Use ksh93
