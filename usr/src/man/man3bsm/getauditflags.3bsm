.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetauditflagsbin()\fR function converts the character representation
of audit values pointed to by \fIauditstring\fR into \fBau_mask_t\fR fields
pointed to by \fImasks\fR. These fields indicate which events are to be
audited when they succeed and which are to be audited when they fail. The
character string syntax is described in \fBaudit_control\fR(4).
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetauditflagschar()\fR function converts the \fBau_mask_t\fR fields
pointed to by \fImasks\fR into a string pointed to by \fIauditstring\fR. If
\fIverbose\fR is 0, the short (2-character) flag names are used. If
\fIverbose\fR is non-zero, the long flag names are used. The
\fIauditstring\fR argument should be large enough to contain the \fBASCII\fR
representation of the events.
.sp
.LP
The \fIauditstring\fR argument contains a series of event names, each one
identifying a single audit class, separated by commas.  The \fBau_mask_t\fR
fields pointed to by \fImasks\fR correspond to binary values defined in
<\fBbsm/audit.h\fR>, which is read by  <\fBbsm/libbsm.h\fR>.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBgetauditflagsbin()\fR and
\fBgetauditflagschar()\fR return 0. Otherwise they return \(mi1.
