.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
There are three levels of granularity for controlling tracing and probe
functions (called probing from here on): probing for the entire process, a
particular thread, and the probe itself can be disabled or enabled.  The
first two (process and thread) are controlled by this interface.  The probe
is controlled with the
.BR prex (1)
utility.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtnf_process_disable()\fR function turns off probing for the process.
The default process state is to have probing enabled. The
\fBtnf_process_enable()\fR function turns on probing for the process.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtnf_thread_disable()\fR function turns off probing for the currently
running thread. Threads are "born" or created with this state enabled. The
\fBtnf_thread_enable()\fR function turns on probing for the currently
running thread.  If the program is a non-threaded program, these two thread
interfaces disable or enable probing for the process.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
A probe is considered enabled only if:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
.BR prex (1)
has enabled the probe AND
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
the process has probing enabled, which is the default or could be set with
\fBtnf_process_enable()\fR AND
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
the thread that hits the probe has probing enabled, which is every thread's
default or could be set with
.BR tnf_thread_enable() .
.RE
.sp
.LP
There is a run time cost associated with determining that the probe is
disabled. To reduce the performance effect of probes, this cost should be
minimized. The quickest way that a probe can be determined to be disabled is
by the enable control that
.BR prex (1)
uses.  Therefore, to disable all
the probes in a process use the
.B disable
command in
.BR prex (1)
rather than
.BR tnf_process_disable() .
.sp
.LP
The \fBtnf_process_disable()\fR and \fBtnf_process_enable()\fR functions
should only be used to toggle probing based on some internal program
condition. The \fBtnf_thread_disable()\fR function should be used to turn
off probing for threads that are uninteresting.
