.SH NAME
smbus \- System Management Bus controller driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsmbus\fR driver is a I2C (Inter IC) nexus driver that allows the system
to communicate with various system      component chips. SMBus is a two-wire
control bus based on the I2C protocol through which systems can communicate
with various I2C devices connected to the bus.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsmbus\fR driver supports byte and block level transfer based on
interrupt and polled mode.
