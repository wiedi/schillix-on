.SH NAME
zcons \- Zone console device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B zcons
character driver exports the console for system zones. The
driver is comprised of two "sides:" a master side with which applications in
the global zone communicate, and a slave side, which receives I/O from the
master side. The slave side is available in the global zones.
.sp
.LP
Applications must not depend on the location of
.B /dev
or
\fB/devices\fR entries exported by
.BR zcons .
Inside a zone, the
\fBzcons\fR slave  side is fronted by \fB/dev/console\fR and other
console-related symbolic links, which are used by applications that expect
to write to the system console.
.sp
.LP
The
.B zcons
driver is Sun Private, and may change in future releases.
