.SH NAME
vr \- driver for VIA Rhine fast Ethernet controllers
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBvr\fR Fast Ethernet driver is GLD based and supporting the VIA Rhine
family of Fast Ethernet adapters:

.LP
The \fBvr\fR driver supports IEEE 802.3 auto-negotiation, flow control and
VLAN tagging.
.SS "Configuration"
.sp
.LP
The default configuration is \fBautonegotiation\fR with bidirectional flow
control. The advertised capabilities for \fBautonegotiation\fR are based on
the capabilities of the PHY.
.sp
.LP
You can set the capabilities advertised by the \fBvr\fR controlled device
using \fBdladm\fR(1M). The driver supports a number of parameters, the names
of which begin with \fBen_\fR (enabled). Each of these boolean parameters
determines if the device advertises that mode of operation when the hardware
supports it.
.sp
.LP
The \fBadv_autoneg_cap\fR parameter controls whether auto-negotiation is
performed. If \fBadv_autoneg_cap\fR is 0, the driver selects the
speed/duplex combination from the first non-zero parameter from this list:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
en_100fdx_cap     100Mpbs full duplex
en_100hdx_cap     100Mpbs half duplex
en_10fdx_cap      10Mpbs full duplex
en_10hdx_cap      10Mpbs half duplex
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
All capabilities default to enabled. Changing any capability parameter
causes the link to go down while the link partners renegotiate the link
using the newly changed capabilities.
.SS "Limitations"
.sp
.LP
The \fBvr\fR driver does not support asymmetric \fBflowcontrol\fR.
VT86C100A and Rhine II adapters are not capable of transmitting
\fBflowcontrol\fR messages
