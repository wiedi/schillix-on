.SH NAME
ses \- SCSI enclosure services device driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBses\fI@target\fB,\fIlun\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The  \fBses\fR device driver is an interface to \fBSCSI\fR enclosure
services devices. These devices sense and monitor the physical conditions in
an enclosure as well as allow access to the status reporting and
configuration features of the enclosure (such as indicator \fBLEDs\fR on the
enclosure.)
.sp
.LP
\fBioctl\fR(9E) calls may be issued to \fBses\fR to determine the state of
the enclosure and to set parameters on the enclosure services device.
.sp
.LP
No \fBses\fR driver properties are defined. Use the \fBses.conf\fR file to
configure the \fBses\fR driver.

.SH IOCTLS
.sp
.LP
The SES driver currently supports the SES, SAFTE and SEN enclosure service
chipsets. SEN and SAFTE protocols are translated internally in the driver
into SES compliant data structures. This enables the SES driver to work
seamlessly with  different protocols and eliminates the need to enhance user
applications.
.sp
.ne 2

.na
\fBSESIOC_GETNOBJ\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
Returns an unsigned integer that represents the number of SES data
structures in the enclosure services chip.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBSESIOC_GETOBJMAP\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
Returns a size array containing \fBses_object\fR elements communicated
through \fBSESIOC_GETNOBJ()\fR. \fBses_object\fR is defined in
\fBsesio.h\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fBSESIOC_INIT\fR
.ad
.RS 21n

Instructs the device to perform a self-diagnostic test. Currently SES & SEN
devices always return success.
.RE

\fBSESIOC_GETENCSTAT\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
Returns an unsigned character that represents status enclosure as defined
by Table 25 in Section 7.1.2 of the SES specification \fINCITS
305-199\fIx\fR.

\fBSESIOC_GETOBJSTAT\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
This ioctl is passed an \fBses_objarg\fR containing the \fBobj_id\fR you
want to set, then fills in the remaining fields according to element status
page of the SES specification.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBSESIOC_SETOBJSTAT\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
Sets options in the control field. You set control field options by filling
out all fields in \fBses_objarg\fR. Field definitions are presented in
Section 7.2.2 of the SES specification.
