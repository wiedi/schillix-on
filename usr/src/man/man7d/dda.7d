.SH NAME
dda \- MMS disk archiving driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The Media Management System (MMS) is a distributed removable media
management system based on the \fIIEEE 1244\fR Media Management System
specification. MMS provides a uniform and consistent tape interface to
client applications.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdda\fR driver is a pseudo tape drive with filesystem file media. The
\fBdda\fR driver is a minimal emulation of the \fBst\fR(7D) tape driver
\fBmtio\fR(7I) interface with BSD no-rewind behavior and is used for MMS
disk archiving. The \fBdda\fR driver should be used with a MMS MMP mount
command handle. You configure DDA tapes, drives, and libraries for disk
archiving using the \fBmmsadm\fR(1M) command. You also use \fBmmsadm\fR(1M)
to mount and unmount \fBdda\fR media.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
To set the number of disk archiving tape drives available for MMS disk
archiving, edit the \fB/kernel/drv/dda.conf\fR configuration file. The
default number of disk archiving tape drives is 20.
.sp
.LP
The disk archiving tape drive devlinks are located in the \fB/dev/dda\fR
directory.
.sp
.LP
The DDA maximum block size is 262144 bytes and the minimum is 1 byte.
