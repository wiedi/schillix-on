.SH NAME
ipw \- Intel Pro. Wireless 802.11b IPW2100B driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBipw\fR \fI802.11b\fR wireless NIC driver is a multi-threaded,
loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver supporting the Data Link
Provider Interface, \fBdlpi\fR(7P), on Intel Pro Wireless  2100B
chipset-based wireless NIC's. Driver  functions  include controller
initialization, wireless \fI802.11b\fR infrastructure network connection,
WEP, frame transmit and receive and promiscuous support.
.SH DRIVER CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The \fBipw\fR driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate
and mode. Supported \fI802.11b\fR data rates are 1, 2, 5.5 and 11
Mbits/sec.
.sp
.LP
The \fBipw\fR driver supports only BSS networks (also known as "ap" or
"infrastructure" networks) and the "open" ("open-system") or "shared system"
authentication. Only WEP encryption is currently supported. You perform
configuration and administration tasks using the \fBdladm\fR(1M) and
\fBwificonfig\fR(1M) utilities.
