.SH NAME
lp \- driver for parallel port
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBinclude <sys/bpp_io.h>\fR
fd = open("/dev/lp\fIn\fR", \fIflags\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlp\fR driver provides the interface to the parallel ports used by
printers for x86 based systems. The \fBlp\fR driver is implemented as a  STREAMS
device.
.SH IOCTLS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBBPPIOC_TESTIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Test transfer readiness. This command checks to see if a read or write transfer
would succeed based on pin status. If a transfer would succeed,  \fB0\fR is
returned. If a transfer would fail,  \fB\(mi1\fR is returned, and \fBerrno\fR is
set to  \fBEIO\fR. The error status can be retrieved using the
\fBBPPIOC_GETERR\fR \fBioctl()\fR call.

\fB\fBBPPIOC_GETERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Get last error status. The argument is a pointer to a  \fBstruct
bpp_error_status\fR. See below for a description of the elements of this
structure. This structure indicates the status of all the appropriate status
bits at the time of the most recent error condition during a  \fBread\fR(2) or
\fBwrite\fR(2) call, or the status of the bits at the most recent
\fBBPPIOC_TESTIO\fR \fBioctl\fR(2) call. The application can check transfer
readiness without attempting another transfer using the  \fBBPPIOC_TESTIO\fR
\fBioctl()\fR.

.SS "Error Pins Structure"
.sp
.LP
This structure and symbols are defined in the include file
\fB<sys/bpp_io.h>\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
struct bpp_error_status {
	   char  timeout_occurred;   /* Not use */
   	char  bus_error;          /* Not use */
   	uchar_t pin_status;       /* Status of pins which could cause an error */
};

/* Values for pin_status field */
#define BPP_ERR_ERR 0x01   /* Error pin active */
#define BPP_SLCT_ERR 0x02  /* Select pin active */
#define BPP_PE_ERR 0x04    /* Paper empty pin active */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Note: Other pin statuses are defined in  \fB<sys/bpp_io.h>\fR, but
\fBBPP_ERR_ERR,\fR \fBBPP_SLCT_ERR\fR and \fBBPP_PE_ERR\fR are the only ones
valid for the x86  \fBlp\fR driver.
.SH ERRORS
.sp

.na
\fB\fBEIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n

A \fBBPPIOC_TESTIO\fR \fBioctl()\fR call is attempted while a condition exists
that would prevent a transfer (such as a peripheral error).

\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR

An \fBioctl()\fR is attempted with an invalid value in the command argument.
