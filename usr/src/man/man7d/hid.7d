.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B hid
driver is a USBA (Solaris USB Architecture) compliant client
driver that supports the \fIHuman Interface Device Class (HID) 1.0\fR
specification. The Human Interface Device (HID) class encompasses devices
controlled by humans to operate computer systems. Typical examples of HID
devices include keyboards, mice, trackballs, and joysticks. HID also covers
front-panel controls such as knobs, switches, and buttons. A USB device with
multiple interfaces may have one interface for audio and a HID interface to
define the buttons that control the audio.
.sp
.LP
The
.B hid
driver is general and primarily handles the USB functionality
of the device and generic HID functionality. For example, HID interfaces are
required to have an interrupt pipe for the device to send data packets, and
the
.B hid
driver opens the pipe to the interrupt endpoint and starts
polling. The
.B hid
driver is also responsible for managing the device
through the default control pipe. In addition to being a USB client driver,
the
.B hid
driver is also a STREAMS driver so that modules may be pushed
on top of it.
.sp
.LP
The HID specification is flexible, and HID devices dynamically describe
their packets and other parameters through a HID report descriptor. The HID
parser is a misc module that parses the HID report descriptor and creates a
database of information about the device. The
.B hid
driver queries the
HID parser to find out the type and characteristics of the HID device. The
HID specification predefines packet formats for the boot protocol keyboard
and mouse.
.SH IOCTLS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B HIDIOCKMGDIRECT
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
This ioctl should only be addressed to a USB keyboard or mouse device. The
.B hid
driver maintains two streams for each USB keyboard/mouse instance:
an internal one for the use of the kernel and an external one for the use of
user applications. This ioctl returns the information of which stream gets
the input for the moment.
.sp
.I arg
must point to a variable of
.B int
type. Upon return,
.B 0
means the internal stream gets the input,
.B 1
means the external stream
gets the input.

This ioctl should only be addressed to a USB keyboard or mouse device. The

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The hid driver currently supports only keyboard, mouse and audio HID
control devices.
.sp
.LP
Normally a mouse is not power managed and consquently, screen darkening can
be undone with a mouse movement. If power management of the mouse is
required, add the following line to
.B hid.conf
then reboot the system:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
hid-mouse-pm-enable;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Modern mice that are power managed require a 'click' to wake up.
Occasionally, this may cause unexpected results.
