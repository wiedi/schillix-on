.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B usbsacm
driver is a loadable STREAMS and USBA (Solaris USB
architecture)-compliant client driver that provides basic asynchronous
communication support for USB modems and ISDN terminal adapters that conform
to the \fIUniversal Serial Bus Communication Device Class Abstract Control
Model (USB CDC ACM)\fR specification. You can download the \fIUSB CDC\fR
specification from the USB website at
\fIhttp://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/usbcdc11.pdf\fR.
Supported devices include mobile phones and PCMCIA cards which provide
modem function by the usb cable. Serial device streams are built with
appropriate modules that are pushed atop the usbsacm driver by the
.BR autopush (1M)
facility.
.sp
.LP
The
.B usbsacm
module supports the
.BR termio "(7I) device control"
functions specified by flags in the c_cflag word of termios structure, and
by the IGNBRK, IGNPAR, PARMRK and INPCK flags in the c_iflag word of the
termios structure. All other \fBtermio\fR(7I) functions must be performed by
STREAMS modules pushed atop the driver. When a device is opened, the
.BR ldterm (7M)
and
.BR ttcompat "(7M) STREAMS modules are automatically"
pushed on top of the stream, providing the standard \fBtermio\fR(7I)
interface. 
.sp
.LP
You use device logical names /dev/term/[\fI0-9\fR]* to access the serial
ports. These names are typically used to provide a logical access point for
a dial-in line that is used with a modem. You can use
.BR pppd (1M)
to
transmit datagrams over these serial ports.
.sp
.LP
A special feature (controlled by the minor device number) is available that
enables a single tty line to be connected to a modem and used for incoming
and outgoing calls. By accessing through device logical name
/dev/cua/[\fI0-9\fR]*, you can open a port without the carrier detect signal
being asserted, either through hardware or an equivalent software mechanism.
These devices are commonly known  as 'dial-out' lines.
.sp
.LP
Unlike onboard serial ports, the
.B usbsacm
ports cannot serve as a
local serial console.
.SH APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
.sp
.LP
A dial-in line can  be  opened  only  if  the corresponding dial-out  line
is closed. A blocking /dev/term open waits until the /dev/cua line is closed
(which drops Data Terminal Ready, after which Carrier Detect usually drops
as well) and carrier is detected again.  A non-blocking  /dev/term open
returns an error if the /dev/cua is open.
.sp
.LP
If the /dev/term line is opened successfully  (usually  only when  carrier
is recognized on the modem), the corresponding      /dev/cua line cannot be
opened. This allows a modem and port to  be  used  for dial-in (by enabling
the line for login in
.BR /etc/inittab )
or dial-out (by
.BR tip (1)
or
.BR uucp (1C))
as
.B /dev/cua0
when no one is logged in on the line.
.sp
.LP
Device hot-removal  is functionally equivalent to a modem disconnect event,
as defined in
.BR termio (7I).
.SH IOCTLS
.sp
.LP
The 
.B usbsacm
driver supports the standard set of
.BR termio (7I)
ioctl calls.
.sp
.LP
The input and output line speeds may be set to any of the following baud
rates: 75, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600,
115200, 230400 or 460800. The speeds cannot be set independently. For
example, when the output speed is set, the input speed is automatically set
to the same speed.
