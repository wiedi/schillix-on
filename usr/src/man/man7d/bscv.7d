.SH NAME
bscv, bscbus, i2bsc \- Blade support chip interface driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.BR bscv ,
.B bscbus
and
.B i2bsc
drivers interface with the
Blade support chip used on Sun Microsystem's Blade server products. These
drivers provide a conduit for passing control, environmental, cpu signature
and event information between Solaris and the Blade support chip.
.sp
.LP
These drivers do not export public interfaces. Instead they make
information available via picl, prtdiag, prtfru and related tools. In
addition, these drivers log Blade support chip environmental event
information into system logs.
