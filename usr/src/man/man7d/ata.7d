ata \- AT attachment disk driver
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBide@unit-\fIaddress\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B ata
driver supports disk and ATAPI CD/DVD devices conforming to
the AT Attachment specification including IDE interfaces. Support is
provided for both parallel ATA (PATA) and serial ATA (SATA) interfaces.
.sp
.LP
Refer to the
.I "Solaris x86 Hardware Compatibility List"
for a list of
supported controllers.
.SH PRECONFIGURE
.sp
.LP
A PCI IDE controller can operate in compatibility mode or in PCI-native
mode. If more than one controller is present in the system, only one can
operate in compatibility mode.
.sp
.LP
If two PATA drives share the same controller, you must set one to master
and the other to slave. If both a PATA disk drive and a PATA CD-ROM drive
utilize the same controller, you can designate the disk drive as the master
with the CD-ROM drive as the slave, although this is not mandatory.
.SS "Supported Settings"

.LP
Supported settings for the primary controller when in compatibility mode
are:

by the system BIOS.
.RE
.SS "Known Problems and Limitations"
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
This driver does not support any RAID features present on a PATA/SATA
controller. As a result, you should configure BIOS to select IDE mode rather
than RAID mode. Some systems may require updating BIOS to allow switching
modes.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
On some systems, the SATA controller must have option ROM enabled or BIOS
will not consider SATA drives as bootable devices.
.RE

.TP
.ie t \(bu

Panasonic LK-MC579B and the Mitsumi FX34005 IDE CD-ROM drives are not
supported and cannot be used to install the Solaris operating environment.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
CMD-604 is unable to handle simultaneous I/O on both IDE interfaces. This
defect causes the Solaris software to hang if both interfaces are used. Use
only the primary IDE interface at address 0x1F0.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
NEC CDR-260/CDR-260R/CDR-273 and Sony CDU-55E ATAPI CD-ROM drives might
fail during installation.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Sony CDU-701 CD-ROM drives must be upgraded to use firmware version 1.0r or
later to support booting from the CD.
.sp
A Compact Flash(CF) card can work as an ATA disk through a CF-to-ATA
adapter. If both card and adapter implement Compact Flash Version 2.0, DMA
is supported. If either of them does not, you should set
ata-disk-dma-enabled to '0.'
.RE
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The ata driver properties are usually set in
.BR ata.conf .
However, it
may be convenient, or in some cases necessary, for you to set some of the
DMA related properties as a system global boot environment property. You set
or modify properties in the boot environment immediately prior to booting
the Solaris kernel using the GRUB boot loader kernel boot command line. You
can also set boot environment properties using the
.BR eeprom "(1M) command"
or by editing the
.B bootenv.rc
configuration file. If a property is set
in both the driver's
.B ata.conf
file and the boot environment, the
.B ata.conf
property takes precedence.
.sp
.LP
Property modifications other than with the GRUB kernel  boot  command line
are not effective until you reboot the system.  Property modifications via
the GRUB kernel  boot command  line do not persist across future boots.
.sp
.LP
Direct Memory Access is enabled for disks and atapi CD/DVD by default. If
you want to disable DMA when booting from a CD/DVD, you must first set
atapi-cd-dma-enabled to 0 using the GRUB kernel boot command line.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ata-dma-enabled
.ad
.RS 27n
.rt
This property is examined before the DMA properties discussed below. If it
is set to '0,' DMA is disabled for all ATA/ATAPI devices, and no further
property checks are made. If this property is absent or is set to '1,' DMA
status is determined by further examining one of the other properties listed
below.
.RE

.sp

.mk
.na
.B ata-disk-dma-enabled
.ad
.RS 27n
.rt
This property is examined only for ATA disk devices, and only if
ata-dma-enabled is not set to '0.'
.sp
If ata-disk-dma-enabled set to '0,' DMA is disabled for all ATA disks in
the system. If this property is absent or set to '1,' DMA is enabled for all
ATA disks and no further property checks are made. If needed, this property
should be created by the administrator using the GRUB kernel boot command
line or the
.BR eeprom "(1M) command."

.sp
If atapi-cd-dma-enabled is absent or set to '0,' DMA is disabled for all
ATAPI CD/DVD's. If set to '1,' DMA is enabled and no further property checks
are made.
.sp
The Solaris installation program creates this property in the boot
environment with a value of '1.' It can be changed with the GRUB kernel boot
command line or
.BR eeprom (1M)
as shown in the Example section of this
manpage.

.sp
If atapi-other-dma-enabled is set to '0,' DMA is disabled for all
non-CD/DVD ATAPI devices. If this property is absent or set to '1,' DMA is
enabled and no further property checks are made.
.sp
If needed, this property should be created by the administrator using the
GRUB kernel boot command line or the
.BR eeprom "(1M) command."

.B ATA
controllers support some amount of buffering (blocking). The
purpose is to interrupt the host when an entire buffer full of data has been
read or written instead of using an interrupt for each sector. This reduces
interrupt overhead and significantly increases throughput. The driver
interrogates the controller to find the buffer size. Some controllers hang
when buffering is used, so the values in the configuration file are used by
the driver to reduce the effect of buffering (blocking). The values
presented may be chosen from
.BR 0x1 ,
.BR 0x2 ,
.BR 0x4 ,
.B 0x8
and
.BR 0x10 .
.sp
The values as shipped are set to
.BR 0x1 ,
and they can be tuned to
increase performance.
.sp
If your controller hangs when attempting to use higher block factors, you
may be unable to reboot the system. For x86 based systems, it is recommended
that tuning be performed using a duplicate of the
.B /platform/i86pc/kernel
directory subtree. This ensures that a bootable
kernel subtree exists in the event of a failed test.

When rebooting or shutting down, the driver can set a feature which allows
the drive to return to the power-on settings when the drive receives a
software reset (SRST) sequence. If this property is present and set to 1,
the driver will set the feature to revert to defaults during reset. Setting
this property to 1 may prevent some systems from soft-rebooting and would
require cycling the power to boot the system. If this property is not
present the system will not set the feature to revert to defaults during
reset.
.sp
To determine the string to substitute for <diskmodel>, boot your system
(you may have to press the reset button or power-cycle) and then view
\fB/var/adm/messages\fR. Look for the string "IDE device at targ" or "ATAPI
device at targ." The next line will contain the word "model" followed by the
model number and a comma. Ignore all characters except letters, digits, ".",
"_", and "-". Change uppercase letters to lower case. If the string
revert-<diskmodel> is longer than 31 characters, use only the first 31
characters.
