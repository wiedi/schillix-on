.SH NAME
arn \- Atheros AR9280/9281/9285 IEEE802.11 a/b/g/n wireless network
device
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B arn
IEEE802.11 a/b/g/n wireless driver is a loadable, clonable,
GLDv3-based STREAMS driver supporting Atheros AR9280/9281/9285 IEEE802.11
a/b/g/n wireless network device.
.SS "Configuration"
.sp
.LP
The
.B arn
driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate
and mode. The driver supports only BSS networks (also known as
.B ap
or
.B infrastructure
networks) and \fBopen\fR(or
.BR open-system )
or
.B shared system
authentication. For wireless security, WEP encryption,
WPA-PSK, and WPA2-PSK are currently supported. Configuration and
administration tasks can be performed with the
.BR dladm "(1M) and"
.BR wificonfig (1M)
utilities.
