.SH NAME
rtw \- RealTek 8180L 802.11b Wireless NIC driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B rtw
\fI802.11b\fR wireless NIC driver is a  multi-threaded,
loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based  STREAMS driver supporting RealTek 8180L
chipset-based NIC's.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The
.B rtw
driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate
and mode. Supported
.I 802.11b
data rates are 1, 2, 5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec.
The default is 11.
.sp
.LP
The \fBrtw\fR driver supports only BSS  networks  (also  known as "ap" or
"infrastructure" networks) and "open"(or "open-system") or "shared system"
authentication.
