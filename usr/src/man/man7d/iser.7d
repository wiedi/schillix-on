.SH NAME
iser \- iSCSI Extensions for Remote DMA driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The iSER driver accelerates the iSCSI protocol by mapping the data transfer
phases to Remote DMA (RDMA) operations. No iSER configuration is required
for its use, but an RDMA-capable protocol (RCaP) must be configured and
enabled on both target and initiator endpoints.
.sp
.LP
Currently, InfiniBand RC is the supported RCaP, and for discovery IP over
IB must be configured on both the initiator and target. If Infiniband (IB)
hardware is present and an Infiniband reliable-connected (RC) connection can
be established then an iSER-enabled initiator uses iSER connections to
iSER-enabled targets. Otherwise the connection is established using IP-based
connectivity.
