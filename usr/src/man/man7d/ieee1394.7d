.SH NAME
ieee1394, firewire, 1394 \- Solaris IEEE-1394 Architecture
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
IEEE-1394 provides a means for interconnecting devices  in computer and
home entertainment systems. (The IEEE-1394 architecture is also known as
Firewire, an Apple Computer trademark, and i.Link, a Sony trademark). The
most common IEEE-1394 devices  are digital camcorders, mass-storage devices
and cameras (including webcam-type devices). For more information on USB,
refer to the 1394 Trade Association website at
http://\fIwww.1394ta.org\fR.
.sp
.LP
The Solaris IEEE-1394 architecture supports up to 63 hot-pluggable
IEEE-1394 devices per IEEE-1394 bus. The maximum data transfer rate is 400
Mbits, depending on the capabilities of the attached device.
.sp
.LP
The Solaris IEEE-1394 architecture supports devices implementing a number
of different specifications. The basic behavior of the IEEE-1394 bus is
described in the
.I "IEEE 1394-1995"
and
.IR "IEEE 1394a-2000"
specifications.
.sp
.LP
IEEE-1394 host controllers implementing the 1394 Open Host Controller
Interface specification are supported. Camcorders      implementing the
.I IEC 61883
and 1394 Trade Association AV/C specifications are
.RI "supported. Mass-storage devices implementing the" " ANSI SBP-2"
specification are supported. Digital cameras implementing the 1394 Trade
Association 1394-based Digital Camera (IIDC) specification are supported.
.SH FILES
.sp
.LP
Listed below are drivers and modules which either utilize or are utilized
by the Solaris IEEE-1394 architecture. Drivers in
.B /kernel/drv
are 32
bit drivers (only). Drivers in
.B /kernel/drv/sparcv9
or
.B /kernel/drv/amd64
are 64 bit drivers.
