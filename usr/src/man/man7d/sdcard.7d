.SH NAME
sdcard \- SD/MMC memory card driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsdcard\fR memory card driver supports MultiMediaCard (MMC), Secure
Digital (SD), and Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) memory cards. It uses
the \fBblk2scsa\fR(7D) service to present these cards to the system as SCSI
disks on a virtual SCSI bus, creating a child device to be serviced with
\fBsd\fR(7D). Each card appears as its own SCSI LUN. Cards are hot-pluggable
and removable.
.SH DEVICE SPECIAL FILES
.sp
.LP
Disk block special file names are located in \fB/dev/dsk\fR. Raw file names
are located in \fB/dev/rdsk\fR.  See \fBsd\fR(7D).
.SH IOCTLS
.sp
.LP
See \fBdkio\fR(7I)
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
See \fBsd\fR(7D) and \fBblk2scsa\fR(7D). Additionally, \fBsdcard\fR may
issue the following warnings, which indicate a failure to identify the card
as a supported type:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
"Unknown SD CSD version (%d)"
"Unknown MMC CSD version (%d)"
"Unknown MMCA version (%d)"
"Card type unknown"
.fi
.in -2

.SH FILES
.sp
.LP
Device special files for the storage device are created in the same way as
those for a SCSI disk. See \fBsd\fR(7D) for more information.
