.SH NAME
grbeep \-  Platform-dependent beep driver for SMBus-based hardware
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
beep@unit-address
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgrbeep\fR driver generates beeps on platforms (including Sun Blade 100, 150, 1500, 2500) that use SMBbus-based registers and USB keyboards. When the \fBKIOCCMD\fR ioctl is issued to the USB keyboard module (see \fBusbkbm\fR(7M)) with command \fBKBD_CMD_BELL/KBD_CMD_NOBELL\fR, \fBusbkbm\fR(7M) passes the request to the \fBgrbeep\fR driver to turn the beep on and off, respectively.
