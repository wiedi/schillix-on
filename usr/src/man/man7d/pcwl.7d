.SH NAME
pcwl \- Lucent/PrismII 802.11b wireless NIC driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The 
.B pcwl
\fI802.11b\fR wireless NIC driver is a multi- threaded,
loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver. It supports the pccard and
PCI/MiniPCI cards with the Lucent and PrismII
.I 802.11b
chipsets on x86
and SPARC.
.SH DRIVER CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The
.B pcwl
driver supports
.I 802.11b
data rates of 1, 2, 5.5 and 11
(Mbits/sec). The default is 11.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpcwl\fR driver supports BSS networks (also known as "ap" or
"infrastructure" networks) and IBSS (or "ad-hoc") networks. For
authentication type, the \fBpcwl\fR driver supports the "open" (or
"open-system") mode and the "shared-key" mode. For encryption type, only WEP
is currently supported. You perform configuration and administration tasks
using the \fBdladm\fR(1M) and \fBwificonfig\fR(1M) utilities.
