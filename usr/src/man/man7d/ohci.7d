.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBohci\fR driver is a USBA (Solaris USB Architecture) compliant nexus
driver that supports the \fIOpen Host Controller Interface Specification
1.1\fR, an industry standard developed by Compaq, Microsoft, and National
Semiconductor. 
.sp
.LP
The \fBohci\fR driver supports bulk, interrupt, control and isochronous
transfers.
