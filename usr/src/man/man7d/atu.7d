.SH NAME
atu \- Atmel AT76C50x USB IEEE 802.11b Wireless Device Driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B "atu 802.11b"
wireless driver is a multi-threaded, loadable,
clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver supporting the Atmel AT76C50x
chipset-based wireless devices.
.SS "Configuration"
.sp
.LP
The
.B atu
driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate
and mode. Supported 802.11b data rates are 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbits/sec.
.sp
.LP
The
.B atu
driver supports only BSS networks (also known as
.B ap
or
\fBinfrastructure\fR networks).
.sp
.LP
\fBopen\fR (or
.BR open-system )
and
.B "shared key"
authentication modes
are supported. Encryption types WEP40 and WEP104 are supported.
