.SH NAME
iwp \- Intel WiFi Link 6000 Series Device Driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBiwp\fR 802.11b/g wireless NIC driver is a multi-threaded, loadable,
clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver which supports the Intel WiFi Link 6000
series chipset-based NICs.
.SS "Configuration"
.sp
.LP
The \fBiwp\fR driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate
and mode. Supported 802.11b data rates are 1, 2, 5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec.
Supported 802.11g data rates are 1, 2, 5.5, 11, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and
54 Mbits/sec.
.sp
.LP
The \fBiwp\fR driver only supports BSS networks, (also known as \fBap\fR or
\fBinfrastructure\fR networks), \fBopen\fR(or \fBopen-system\fR) , or
\fBshared system\fR authentication.
