.SH NAME
iscsi \- iSCSI software initiator driver and service
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBiscsi\fR driver is a software initiator that transports SCSI
commands over TCP/IP as described in \fIRFC 3720\fR.
.sp
.LP
The initiator driver is administered through \fBiscsiadm\fR(1M). The
\fBiscsi\fR initiator service is managed by the service management facility,
\fBsmf\fR(5), under the following FMRI:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/iscsi/initiator:default
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The \fBiscsi\fR initiator acts as a host adapter driver that attaches the
appropriate target driver, for example, \fBsd\fR(7D) for disks, or
\fBst\fR(7D) for tapes) for devices it discovers. See the \fISystem
Administration Guide: Devices and File Systems\fR for more information.
.sp
.LP
Once enabled, the \fBiscsi\fR initiator service ensures the right timing to
start the discovery and enumeration of iSCSI devices during boot, but it
doesn't guarantee the success of discovery for certain iSCSI devices. If the
service is disabled, \fBiscsi\fR driver stops the discovery and enumeration
of iSCSI devices and also tries to offline all existing iSCSI devices.
\fBiscsiadm\fR(1M) works only when the service is enabled.
.sp
.LP
iSCSI \fBboot\fR(1M) is not affected by the status of the \fBiscsi\fR
initiator service.
