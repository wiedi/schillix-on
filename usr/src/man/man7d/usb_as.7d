usb_as \- USB audio streaming driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B usb_as
driver is a USBA (Solaris USB Architecture) compliant
client driver that supports the
.I "USB Audio Class 1.0"
specification.
.sp
.LP
The
.B usb_as
driver processes audio data messages during play and
record and sets sample frequency, precision, encoding and other functions on
request from the USB audio control driver. See \fBusb_ac\fR(7D).
.sp
.LP
This driver is plumbed under the USB audio control driver and does not
directly interface with the user application.

.B No bandwidth available.
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
There is no bandwidth available for the isochronous pipe. As a result, no
data is transferred during play and record.

\fBOperating a full/high speed audio device on a high speed port is not
supported.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The USB software does not currently support full or high speed audio
devices connected to an external USB 2.0 hub that is linked to a port of a
USB 2.0 host controller. Audio devices must be connected directly to a port
of a USB 2.0 controller or to any USB 1.1 port.

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A USB audio streaming interface was hot-removed while open. A new device
was hot-inserted which is not identical to the original USB audio device.
Please disconnect the USB device and reconnect the device to the same
port.
