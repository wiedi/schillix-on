.SH NAME
pcan \- Cisco Aironet 802.11b wireless NIC driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpcan\fR wireless NIC driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver. It supports the pccard and PCI/MiniPCI cards with the Cisco Aironet \fI802.11b\fR chipset. For pccard, the driver works in both SPARC and x86 (32-bit/64-bit) modes. For PCI/MiniPCI card, the driver works in 32-bit x86 mode only. 
.SH DRIVER CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpcan\fR driver supports \fI802.11b\fR data rates of 1, 2, 5.5 and 11 (Mbits/sec). The default is 11.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpcan\fR driver supports BSS networks (also known as "ap" or "infrastructure" networks) and IBSS networks (also known as "ad-hoc" networks). For authentication type, the \fBpcan\fR driver supports the "open" (or "open-system") mode. For encryption type, only WEP is currently supported. You perform configuration and administration tasks using the \fBdladm\fR(1M) and \fBwificonfig\fR(1M) utilities.
