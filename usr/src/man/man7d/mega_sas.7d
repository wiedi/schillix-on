.SH NAME
mega_sas \- SCSI HBA driver for LSI MegaRAID SAS controller
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B mega_sas
MegaRAID controller host bus adapter driver is a
SCSA-compliant nexus  driver that supports the Dell PERC 5/E, 5/i, 6/E and
6/i RAID controllers, the IBM ServeRAID-MR10k SAS/SATA  controller and the
LSI MegaRAID SAS/SATA 8308ELP, 8344ELP, 84016E, 8408ELP, 8480ELP, 8704ELP,
8704EM2, 8708ELP, 8708EM2, 8880EM2 and 8888ELP series of controllers.
.sp
.LP
Supported RAID features include RAID levels 0, 1, 5, and 6, RAID spans 10,
50 and 60, online capacity expansion (OCE), online RAID level migration
(RLM), auto resume after loss of  system power during arrays, array rebuild
or reconstruction (RLM) and configurable stripe size up to 1MB. Additional
supported RAID features include check consistency for background data
integrity, patrol read for media scanning and repairing, 64 logical drive
support, up to 64TB LUN support, automatic rebuild and global and dedicated
hot spare support.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmega_sas.conf\fR file contains no user configurable parameters.
Please configure your hardware through the related BIOS utility or the
MegaCli configuration utility. If  you  want to install to a drive attached
to a mega_sas HBA, you should create the virtual drive first from the BIOS
before running the Solaris install. You can obtain the MegaCli utility from
the LSI website.
.sp
.LP
The
.B mega_sas
device can support up to  64 virtual disks. Note that
BIOS numbers the virtual disks as 1 through 64, however in the Solaris
operating environment virtual disks are numbered from 0 to 63.  Also note
that SAS and SATA drives cannot be configured into the same virtual disk.
.SH KNOWN PROBLEMS AND LIMITATIONS
.sp
.LP
The
.B mega_sas
driver does not support the LSI MegaRAID SAS 8204ELP,
8204XLP, 8208ELP, and 8208XLP controllers.
