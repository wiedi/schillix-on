.SH NAME
wusb_df, hwa1480_fw \- WUSB firmware download driver and firmware module for Intel i1480 chipset
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwusb_df\fR driver is a Solaris USB Architecture (USBA) compliant client driver that is used to download firmware for Host Wire Adapter (HWA) dongles that use Intel i1480 chipsets.
.sp
.LP
Currently, the \fBwusb_df\fR driver can only download driver for Intel i1480 based HWA dongles. The \fBhwa1480_fw\fR is a miscellaneous module which is transformed from Intel's firmware binary version RC1.3PA2-20070828. \fBwusb_df\fR reads firmware data from \fBhwa1480_fw\fR module and downloads it to HWA hardware.
.sp
.LP
Users can use \fBelfwrap\fR(1) to transform new firmware binary. Users must use the same name as \fBhwa1480_fw\fR, since \fBwusb_df\fR only recognizes this symbol.
