.SH NAME
rwn \- Ralink RT2700/2800 IEEE802.11 a/b/g/n wireless network device
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B rwn
IEEE802.11 a/b/g/n wireless driver is a multi-threaded,
loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver supporting Ralink
RT2700/RT2800 IEEE802.11 a/b/g/n wireless network device.
.SS "Configuration"
.sp
.LP
The
.B rwn
driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate
and mode. The driver supports only BSS networks (also known as
.B ap
or
\fBinfrastructure\fR networks) and \fBopen\fR (\fBopen-system\fR) or
\fBshared system\fR authentication.
.sp
.LP
For wireless security, WEP encryption, WPA-PSK, and WPA2-PSK are currently
supported. You can perform configuration and administration tasks using the
.BR dladm (1M)
and \fBwificonfig\fR(1M) utilities.
