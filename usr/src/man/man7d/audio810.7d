.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Some laptops (including Sony VAIO, among others), have their on-board
amplifier powered down by default, meaning that audio is suppressed even if
hardware and the \fBaudio810\fR driver are working normally. To correct
this, set the \fBac97-invert-amp=1\fR property in the
\fB/kernel/drv/audio810.conf\fR to power-up the amplifier.
