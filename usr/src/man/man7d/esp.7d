.SH NAME
esp \- ESP SCSI Host Bus Adapter Driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBesp@\fIsbus-slot\fR,80000\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBesp\fR Host Bus Adapter driver is a \fBSCSA\fR compliant nexus
driver that supports the Emulex family of esp \fBSCSI\fR chips (esp100,
esp100A, esp236, fas101, fas236).
.sp
.LP
The  \fBesp\fR driver supports the standard functions provided by the
\fBSCSA\fR interface. The driver supports tagged and untagged queuing, fast
\fBSCSI\fR (on FAS esp's only), almost unlimited transfer size (using a
moving \fBDVMA\fR window approach),  and auto request sense; but it does not
support linked commands.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The  \fBesp\fR driver can be configured by defining properties in
\fBesp.conf\fR which override the global \fBSCSI\fR settings. Supported
properties are: \fBscsi-options\fR, \fBtarget<\fIn\fR>-scsi-options\fR,
\fBscsi-reset-delay\fR, \fBscsi-watchdog-tick\fR, \fBscsi-tag-age-limit\fR,
\fBscsi-initiator-id\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBtarget<\fIn\fR>-scsi-options\fR overrides the  \fBscsi-options\fR
property value for \fBtarget<\fIn\fR>\fR. <\fIn\fR> can vary from \fB0\fR to
\fB7\fR.
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBscsi_hba_attach\fR(9F) for details.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRA sample of esp configuration file.
.sp
.LP
Create a file \fB/kernel/drv/esp.conf\fR and add this line:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
scsi-options=0x78;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
This will disable tagged queuing, fast \fBSCSI,\fR and Wide mode for all
\fBesp\fR instances. To disable an option for one specific  \fBesp\fR (refer
to \fBdriver.conf\fR(4)):

.sp
.in +2
.nf
name="esp"
parent="/iommu@f,e0000000/sbus@f,e0001000/espdma@f,400000"
       reg=0xf,0x800000,0x40
       target1-scsi-options=0x58
       scsi-options=0x178 scsi-initiator-id=6;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Note that the default initiator ID in OBP is 7 and that the change to ID 6
will occur at attach time. It may be preferable to change the initiator ID
in OBP.

.sp
.LP
The above would set  \fBscsi-options\fR for target 1 to  \fB0x58\fR and for
all other targets on this \fBSCSI\fR bus to  \fB0x178\fR. The physical
pathname of the parent can be determined using the \fB/devices\fR tree or
following the link of the logical device name:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fBls -l /dev/rdsk/c0t3d0s0\fR
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root   root   88 Aug 22 13:29 /dev/rdsk/c0t3d0s0 ->
\&../../devices/iommu@f,e0000000/sbus@f,e0001000/espdma@f,400000/
              esp@f,800000/sd@3,0:a,raw
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The register property values can be determined from \fBprtconf\fR(1M)
output (\fB-v\fR option):

.sp
.in +2
.nf
	esp, instance #0
	....
       	    Register Specifications:
                Bus Type=0xf, Address=0x800000, Size=40
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
To set scsi-options more specifically per target:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
target1-scsi-options=0x78;
device-type-scsi-options-list =
        "SEAGATE ST32550W", "seagate-scsi-options" ;
seagate-scsi-options = 0x58;
scsi-options=0x3f8;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The above would set \fBscsi-options\fR for target 1 to \fB0x78\fR and for
all other targets on this \fBSCSI\fR bus to \fB0x378\fR except for one
specific disk type which will have \fBscsi-options\fR set to 0x58.

.sp
.LP
\fBscsi-options\fR specified per target ID has the highest precedence,
followed by \fBscsi-options\fR per device type. To get the inquiry string
run probe-scsi or probe-scsi-all command at the ok prompt before booting the
system.

.sp
.LP
Global, for example. for all esp instances, \fBscsi-options\fR per bus has
the lowest precedence.

.sp
.LP
The system needs to be rebooted before the specified \fBscsi-options\fR
take effect.

The \fBesp\fR driver exports properties indicating per target the

value is the data transfer rate in KB/sec. The \fBtarget-TQ\fR property has
