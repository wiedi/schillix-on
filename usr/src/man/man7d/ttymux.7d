.SH NAME
ttymux \- Serial I/O multiplexing STREAMS device driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

multiplexer@0,0:input

multiplexer@0,0:output
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
.B ttymux
is a STREAMS multiplexer driver that connects multiple serial
devices to the system console. Using this driver, input from multiple
physical devices can be multiplexed onto a single input stream for the
system console. Output written to the console can be distributed to multiple
physical devices to provide redundant console interfaces to a system. Input
and output can be multiplexed to or from a separate list of devices.
.sp
.LP
.B ttymux
is a STREAMS multiplexer for serial drivers (such as
.BR se (7D))
that comply with the Solaris terminal subsystem interface.
.sp
.LP
Currently, multiplexer interfaces are provided for system console I/O only
and not for general serial I/O multiplexing. Multiplexer interfaces are
currently not available for all platforms. Please see NOTES.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Successful loading of this driver and its services depends on the
.B EEPROM
or
.B NVRAM
settings in effect at the most recent system
reboot. Without the platform firmware support, this feature cannot be
enabled. Currently, this support is provided only on a NetraCT product
family.
.sp
.LP
Use caution when enabling this feature to perform console input
multiplexing, particularly during super-user login. Because no security
measures are enabled when the driver is in operation, you must clearly
understand the security implications involved in using this feature and take
appropriate measures to provide maximum protection to the host. This can
include such steps as enabling input to physically secured console devices
only.
.sp
.LP
The
.B ttymux
driver does not handle the behavioral differences in
control characteristics of different terminal types (for example, an ESCAPE
sequence.) As a result, multiple terminal types are not supported
simultaneously. Please refer to the platform user guide for more
information.
