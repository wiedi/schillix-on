.SH NAME
urtw \- RealTek RTL8187L/RTL8187B USB 802.11b/g Wireless Driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B urtw
802.11b/g wireless driver is a multi-threaded, loadable,
clonable, GLDv3-basedSTREAMS driver supporting the RealTek RTL8187L
chipset-based wireless devices.
.SS "Configuration"
.sp
.LP
The
.B urtw
driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and
mode. Supported 802.11b data rates are 1, 2, 5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec. Supported
802.11g data rates are 1, 2, 5.5, 11, 6, 9, 12, 8, 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbits/sec.
The
.B atu
driver supports only BSS networks (also known as\fBap\fR or
\fBinfrastructure\fR networks) and \fBopen\fR (or
.BR open-system )
or
\fBshared system\fR authentication.
