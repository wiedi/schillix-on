.LP
In the current version of Solaris,
.B /dev/msglog
is an alias for
.BR /dev/sysmsg .
In future versions of Solaris, writes to
\fB/dev/msglog\fR may be directed into a  more general logging mechanism
such as
.BR syslogd (1M).
.sp
.LP
.BR syslog (3C)
provides a more general logging mechanism  than
\fB/dev/msglog\fR and should be used in preference to \fB/dev/msglog\fR
whenever possible.
