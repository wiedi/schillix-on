.SH NAME
ath \- Atheros AR52xx 802.11b/g wireless NIC driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B ath
\fI802.11b/g\fR  wireless  NIC driver is a  multi-threaded,
loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver for the Atheros  AR52xx
(AR5210/5211/5212) chipset-based  wireless NIC.
.sp
.LP
The
.B ath
driver functions include controller initialization, wireless
\fI802.11b/g\fR infrastructure network connection, WEP, frame transmit and
receive, and promiscuous and multi-cast  support.
.SH DRIVER CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The
.B ath
driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rates
and mode. Supported
.I 802.11b
data rates (Mbits/sec.) are 1, 2, 5.5 and
11. Supported
.I 802.11g
data rates (Mbits/sec.) are 1, 2, 5.5, 11, 6, 9,
12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54.
.sp
.LP
 The \fBath\fR driver supports only BSS networks (also known  as "ap" or "infrastructure" networks) and the "open" (or "opensystem") authentication type. Only  WEP encryption is currently supported. Configuration and administration can be performed  through  the  \fBdladm\fR(1M) or  \fBwificonfig\fR(1M) utilities.
