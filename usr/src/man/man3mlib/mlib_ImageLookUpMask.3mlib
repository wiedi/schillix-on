.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmlib_ImageLookUpMask()\fR function maps the source image to the
destination image by using the user-specified lookup table and applying a
channel mask.
.sp
.LP
The source and destination images must have the same width and height. The
source image can be a single channel image or can have the same number of
channels as the destination image. One of the following equations is used
accordingly: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
dst[x][y][i] = table[i][src[x][y][0]]
dst[x][y][i] = table[i][src[x][y][i]]
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The source and destination images can have different data types. See the
following table for available variations of the table lookup function on
image types:

.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.LP
The function takes the following arguments:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIdst\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
Pointer to destination image.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIsrc\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
Pointer to source image.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fItable\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
Pointer to lookup table. The data type of the lookup table is the same as
the destination image. The number of entries in the lookup table is
determined by the type of the input image. The format of the lookup table
is:
.sp
\fBtable[channel][index]\fR
.sp
The \fBMLIB_BIT\fR type entries are indexed from 0 to 1. The
\fBMLIB_BYTE\fR type entries are indexed from 0 to 255. The \fBMLIB_SHORT\fR
type entries are indexed from -32768 to -1, then from 0 to 32767. The
\fBMLIB_USHORT\fR type entries are indexed from 0 to 65535. The
\fBMLIB_INT\fR type entries are indexed from -2147483648 to -1, and then
from 0 to 2147483647.
.RE

.sp

\fIchannels\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
Number of channels in the lookup table. If the number of channels is equal
to 1, then the same table is applied to all channels. Otherwise, the number
of channels must be no less than the number of valid 1s in the channel
mask.

\fIcmask\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
Channel mask. Each bit of the mask represents a channel of an image or a
lookup table. Only the rightmost four bits of cmask are considered, where
the least significant bit of cmask is for the last channel. The channels
corresponding to 0 bits of cmask are not processed or used. cmask is always
applied to the destination image dst. If the source image src has the same
number of channels as dst, then cmask is also applied to src. Otherwise,
each channel of src is used for each cmask bit with a value of 1, in this
order: the first channel for the first 1 from the left in cmask. If src has
only one channel, then the same src channel is used for every cmask bit with
a value of 1. If the lookup table has the same number of channels as dst,
then cmask is also applied to table. Otherwise, each table channel is used
for each cmask bit with a value of 1, in this order: the first channel for
the first 1 from the left in cmask. If table has only one channel, then the
same table channel is used for every cmask bit with a value of 1.

.SH RETURN VALUES
