#include <mlib.h>

\fBmlib_status\fR \fBmlib_VideoIDCT_IEEE_S16_S16\fR(\fBmlib_s16\fR \fIblock[64]\fR,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmlib_VideoIDCT_IEEE_S16_S16()\fR function computes the inverse DCT
(called IDCT) for the output IDCT block of data type mlib_s16 and input DCT
coefficients of data type mlib_s16. This function is guaranteed to be
IEEE-1180 -compliant. The output of the IDCT routine is the difference
between the current block and the reference block. The difference pixel can
occupy nine bits and is represented as a 16-bit datum. The output must be
added to the motion-compensated reference block in order to reconstruct the
current block.
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.LP
The function takes the following arguments:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIblock\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Pointer to an 8x8 motion-compensated block that is the difference between
the reference block and the current block. block need not be 8-byte
aligned.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIcoeffs\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Pointer to the source DCT coefficients. coeffs need not be 8-byte
aligned.
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The function returns \fBMLIB_SUCCESS\fR if successful. Otherwise it returns
\fBMLIB_FAILURE\fR.
