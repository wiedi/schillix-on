.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B dat_evd_set_unwaitable()
transitions the Event Dispatcher into an
unwaitable state. In this state, calls to
.BR dat_evd_wait (3DAT)
return
synchronously with a
.B DAT_INVALID_STATE
error, and threads already
blocked in
.B dat_evd_wait()
are awakened and return with a
\fBDAT_INVALID_STATE\fR error without any further action by the Consumer. The
actual state of the Event Dispatcher is accessible through
.BR dat_evd_query (3DAT)
and is
.B DAT_EVD_UNWAITABLE
after the return of
this operation.
.sp
.LP
This call does not affect a CNO associated with this EVD at all. Events
arriving on the EVD after it is set unwaitable still trigger the CNO (if
appropriate), and can be retrieved with
.BR dat_evd_dequeue (3DAT).
Because
events can arrive normally on the EVD, the EVD might overflow; the Consumer
is expected to protect against this possibility.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.B DAT_SUCCESS
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
The operation was successful.

The
.I evd_handle
parameter is invalid.
