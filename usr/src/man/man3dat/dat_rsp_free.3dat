.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B dat_rsp_free()
function destroys a specified instance of the
Reserved Service Point.
.sp
.LP
Any incoming Connection Requests for the Connection Qualifier on the
destroyed Service Point was listening on are automatically rejected by the
Provider with the return analogous to the no listening Service Point.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of the Connection Requests in progress is undefined and left
to an implementation, but it must be consistent. This means that either a
Connection Requested Event was generated for the Event Dispatcher associated
with the Service Point, including the creation of the Connection Request
instance, or the Connection Request is rejected by the Provider without any
local notification.
.sp
.LP
This operation has no effect on previously generated Connection Request
Event and Connection Request.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of this operation with creation of a Service Point on the same
Connection Qualifier at the same time is not defined. Consumers are advised
to avoid this scenario.
.sp
.LP
For the Reserved Service Point, the Consumer-provided Endpoint reverts to
Consumer control. Consumers shall be aware that due to a race condition,
this Reserved Service Point might have generated a Connection Request Event
and passed the associated Endpoint to a Consumer in it.
.sp
.LP
Use of the handle of the destroyed Service Point in any consequent
operation fails.
.SH RETURN VALUES
