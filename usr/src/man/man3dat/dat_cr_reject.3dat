.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_cr_reject()\fR function rejects a Connection Request from the
Active remote side requesting Endpoint. If the Provider passed a local
Endpoint into a Consumer for the Public Service Point-created Connection
Request, that Endpoint reverts to Provider Control. The behavior of an
operation on that Endpoint is undefined. The local Endpoint that the
Consumer provided for Reserved Service Point reverts to Consumer control,
and the Consumer is free to use in any way it wants.
.sp
.LP
The operation is synchronous. This operation also destroys the Connection
Request instance. Use of the handle of the destroyed Connection Request in
any consequent operation fails.
