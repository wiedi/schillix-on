.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_rmr_free()\fR function destroys an instance of the RMR.
.sp
.LP
Use of the handle of the destroyed RMR in any subsequent operation except
for the \fBdat_rmr_free()\fR fails. Any remote RDMA operation that uses the
destroyed RMR
.IR rmr_context ,
whose Transport-specific request arrived to
the local host after the \fBdat_rmr_free()\fR has completed, fails and
reports a protection violation. Remote RDMA operation that uses the
destroyed RMR
.IR rmr_context ,
whose Transport-specific request arrived to
the local host prior to the \fBdat_rmr_free()\fR return, might or might not
complete successfully. If it fails,
.B DAT_DTO_ERR_REMOTE_ACCESS
is
reported in
.B DAT_DTO_COMPLETION_STATUS
for the remote RDMA DTO and the
connection is broken.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_rmr_free()\fR function is allowed on either bound or unbound
RMR. If RMR is bound, \fBdat_rmr_free()\fR unbinds (free HCA TPT and other
resources and whatever else binds with length of 0 should do), and then free
RMR.

The operation was successful.
