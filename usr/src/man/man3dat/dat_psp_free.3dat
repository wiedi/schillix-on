.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_psp_free()\fR function destroys a specified instance of the
Public Service Point.
.sp
.LP
Any incoming Connection Requests for the Connection Qualifier on the
destroyed Service Point it had been listening on are automatically rejected
by the Provider with the return analogous to the no listening Service
Point.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of the Connection Requests in progress is undefined and left
to an implementation. But it must be consistent. This means that either a
Connection Requested Event has been generated for the Event Dispatcher
associated with the Service Point, including the creation of the Connection
Request instance, or the Connection Request is rejected by the Provider
without any local notification.
.sp
.LP
This operation shall have no effect on previously generated Connection
Requested Events. This includes Connection Request instances and,
potentially, Endpoint instances created by the Provider.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of this operation with creation of a Service Point on the same
Connection Qualifier at the same time is not defined. Consumers are advised
to avoid this scenario.
.sp
.LP
Use of the handle of the destroyed Public Service Point in any consequent
operation fails.
