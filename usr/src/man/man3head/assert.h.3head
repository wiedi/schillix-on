.SH NAME
assert.h, assert \- verify program assertion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBassert.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBassert.h\fR> header defines the \fBassert()\fR macro. It refers to
the macro
.B NDEBUG
which is not defined in the header. If \fBNDEBUG\fR
is defined as a macro name before the inclusion of this header, the
\fBassert()\fR macro is defined simply as:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
#define assert(ignore)((void) 0)
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Otherwise, the macro behaves as described in \fBassert\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
The
.B assert()
macro is redefined according to the current state of
\fBNDEBUG\fR each time <\fBassert.h\fR> is included.
.sp
.LP
The
.B assert()
macro is implemented as a macro, not as a function. If
the macro definition is suppressed in order to access an actual function,
the behavior is undefined.
