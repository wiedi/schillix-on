.SH NAME
wordexp.h, wordexp \- word-expansion types
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBwordexp.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBwordexp.h\fR> header defines the structures and symbolic constants
used by the \fBwordexp()\fR and \fBwordfree()\fR functions. See
\fBwordexp\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
The structure type \fBwordexp_t\fR contains the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
size_t we_wordc        /* count of words matched by words */
char   **we_wordv      /* pointer to list of expanded words */
size_t we_offs         /* slots to reserve at the beginning
                          of we_wordv */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fIflags\fR argument to the \fBwordexp()\fR function is the
bitwise-inclusive OR of the following flags:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBWRDE_APPEND\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Append words to those previously generated.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBWRDE_DOOFFS\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Number of null pointers to prepend to \fBwe_wordv\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBWRDE_NOCMD\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Fail if command substitution is requested.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBWRDE_REUSE\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The \fBpwordexp\fR argument was passed to a previous successful call to
\fBwordexp()\fR, and has not been passed to \fBwordfree()\fR. The result is
the same as if the application had called \fBwordfree()\fR and then called
\fBwordexp()\fR without \fBWRDE_REUSE\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBWRDE_SHOWERR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Do not redirect \fBstderr\fR to \fB/dev/null\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBWRDE_UNDEF\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Report error on an attempt to expand an undefined shell variable.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The following constants are defined as error return values:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBWRDE_BADCHAR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
One of the unquoted characters\(em<newline>, '|', '&', ';', '<', '>', '(',
\&')', '{', '}'\(emappears in words in an inappropriate context.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBWRDE_BADVAL\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Reference to undefined shell variable when \fBWRDE_UNDEF\fR is set in
\fIflags\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBWRDE_CMDSUB\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Command substitution requested when \fBWRDE_NOCMD\fR was set in
\fIflags\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBWRDE_NOSPACE\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Attempt to allocate memory failed.
.RE
