.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBstdint.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBstdint.h\fR> header declares sets of integer types having specified
widths, and defines corresponding sets of macros. It also defines macros
that specify limits of integer types corresponding to types defined in other
standard headers.
.sp
.LP
The ``width'' of an integer type is the number of bits used to store its
value in a pure binary system; the actual type can use more bits than that
(for example, a 28-bit type could be stored in 32 bits of actual storage).
An N-bit signed type has values in the range -2^N-1 or 1-2^N-1 to 2^N-1-1,
while an N-bit unsigned type has values in the range 0 to 2^N-1.
.sp
.LP
Types are defined in the following categories:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
integer types having certain exact widths
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o

.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o

.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
integer types having greatest width
.RE
.sp
.LP
Some of these types may denote the same type.
.sp
.LP
Corresponding macros specify limits of the declared types and construct
suitable constants.
.sp
.LP
For each type described herein that the implementation provides, the
<\fBstdint.h\fR> header declares that \fBtypedef\fR name and defines the
associated macros. Conversely, for each type described herein that the
implementation does not provide, the <\fBstdint.h\fR> header does not
declare that \fBtypedef\fR name, nor does it define the associated macros.
An implementation provides those types described as required, but need not
provide any of the others (described as optional).
.SS "Integer Types"
.sp
.LP
When \fBtypedef\fR names differing only in the absence or presence of the
initial
.B u
are defined, they denote corresponding signed and unsigned
types as described in the ISO/IEC 9899: 1999 standard, Section 6.2.5; an
implementation providing one of these corresponding types must also provide
the other.
.sp
.LP
In the following descriptions, the symbol
.I N
represents an unsigned
decimal integer with no leading zeros (for example, 8 or 24, but not 04 or
048).
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B Exact-width integer types
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fBtypedef\fR name \fBint\fIN\fR_t\fR designates a signed integer type
with width
.IR N ,
no padding bits, and a two's-complement representation.
Thus,
.B int8_t
denotes a signed integer type with a width of exactly 8
bits.
.sp
The typedef name \fBuint\fIN\fR_t\fR designates an unsigned integer type
with width
.IR N .
Thus,
.B uint24_t
denotes an unsigned integer type
with a width of exactly 24 bits.
.sp
The following types are required:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
int8_t
int16_t
int32_t
uint8_t
uint16_t
uint32_t
.fi
.in -2

If an implementation provides integer types with width 64 that meet these
requirements, then the following types are required:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
int64_t
uint64_t
.fi
.in -2

In particular, this is the case if any of the following are true:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The implementation supports the
.B _POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG
programming
environment and the application is being built in the \fB_POSI
X_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG\fR programming environment (see the Shell and Utilities
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-200x, c99, Programming Environments).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The implementation supports the
.B _POSIX_V6_LP64_OFF64
programming
environment and the application is being built in the \fB_POSIX_
V6_LP64_OFF64\fR programming environment.
.RE
.RS +4

.ie t \(bu
.el o
The implementation supports the
.B _POSIX_V6_LPBIG_OFFBIG
programming
environment and the application is being built in the
\fB_POSIX_V6_LPBIG_OFFBIG\fR programming environment.
.RE
All other types of this form are optional.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B Minimum-width integer types
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fBtypedef\fR name \fBint_least\fIN\fR_t\fR designates a signed integer
type with a width of at least
.IR N ,
such that no signed integer type with
lesser size has at least the specified width. Thus, \fBint_least32 _t\fR
denotes a signed integer type with a width of at least 32 bits.
.sp
The \fBtypedef\fR name \fBuint_least\fIN\fR_t\fR designates an unsigned
integer type with a width of at least
.IR N ,
such that no unsigned integer
type with lesser size has at least the specified width. Thus, \fBuint_
least16_t\fR denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of at least 16
bits.
.sp
The following types are required:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
int_least8_t
int_least16_t
int_least32_t
int_least64_t
uint_least8_t
uint_least16_t

All other types of this form are optional.

.B Fastest minimum-width integer types
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Each of the following types designates an integer type that is usually
fastest to operate with among all integer types that have at least the
specified width.
.sp
The designated type is not guaranteed to be fastest for all purposes; if
the implementation has no clear grounds for choosing one type over another,
it will simply pick some integer type satisfying the signedness and width
requirements.
.sp
The \fBtypedef\fR name \fBint_fast\fIN\fR_t\fR designates the fastest
signed integer type with a width of at least
.IR N .
The \fBtypedef\fR name
\fBuint_fast\fIN\fR_ t\fR designates the fastest unsigned integer type with
a width of at least
.IR N .
.sp
The following types are required:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
int_fast8_t
int_fast16_t
int_fast32_t
int_fast64_t
uint_fast8_t
uint_fast16_t
