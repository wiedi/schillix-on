.SH NAME
wctype.h, wctype \- wide-character classification and mapping utilities
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBwctype.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBwctype.h\fR> header defines the following types:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B wint_t
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
As described in <\fBwchar.h\fR>.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B wctrans_t
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
A scalar type that can hold values that represent locale-specific character
mappings.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B wctype_t
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
As described in <\fBwchar.h\fR>.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The <\fBwctype.h\fR> header defines the following macro name:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B WEOF
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt
Constant expression of type
.B wint_t
that is returned by several MSE
functions to indicate end-of-file.
.RE

.sp
.LP
For all functions described in this header that accept an argument of type
.BR wint_t ,
the value is representable as a
.B "wchar _t"
or equals the
value of
.BR WEOF .
If this argument has any other value, the behavior is
undefined.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of these functions is affected by the
.B LC_CTYPE
category
of the current locale.
.sp
.LP
Inclusion of the <\fBwctype.h\fR> header can make visible all symbols from
the headers <\fBctype.h\fR>, <\fBstdarg.h\fR>, <\fBstddef.h\fR>,
<\fBstdio.h\fR>, <\fBstdlib.h\fR>, <\fBstring.h\fR>, <\fBtime.h\fR>, and
<\fBwchar.h\fR>.
