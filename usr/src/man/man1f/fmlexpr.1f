.SH NAME
fmlexpr \- evaluate arguments as an expression
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBfmlexpr\fR \fIarguments\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfmlexpr\fR function evaluates its arguments as an expression. After
evaluation, the result is written on the standard output. Terms of the
expression must be separated by blanks. Characters special to \fBFMLI\fR
must be escaped. Note that  \fB30\fR is returned to indicate a zero value,
rather than the null string. Strings containing blanks or other special
characters should be quoted. Integer-valued arguments may be preceded by a
unary minus sign. Internally, integers are treated as 32-bit, 2s complement
numbers.
.sp
.LP
The operators and keywords are listed below. Characters that need to be
escaped are preceded by \fB\e\fR\&. The list is in order of increasing
precedence, with equal precedence operators grouped within \fB{\|}\fR
symbols.

.RS 4n
The matching operator \fB:\fR (colon) compares the first argument with the
second argument which must be a regular expression. Regular expression
syntax is the same as that of \fBed\fR(1), except that all patterns are
"anchored" (that is, begin with \fB^\fR) and, therefore, \fB^\fR is not a
special character, in that context. Normally, the matching operator returns
the number of bytes matched (\fB0\fR on failure). Alternatively, the
\fB(\|.\|.\|.\|)\fR pattern symbols can be used to return a portion of the
first argument.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRIncrementing a variable
.sp
.LP
Add \fB1\fR to the variable \fBa\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBfmlexpr\| $a\| +\| 1 | set \fB-l\fB a\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRSetting a variable equal to a filename
.sp
.LP
For \fB$a\fR equal to either \fB/usr/abc/file\fR or just \fBfile\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBfmlexpr  $a  :   .*/\e(.*\e)  \e|  $a\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
returns the last segment of a path name (that is, \fBfile\fR). Watch out
for \fB/\fR alone as an argument: \fBfmlexpr\fR will take it as the division
operator (see \fBNOTES\fR below).

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRA better representation of Example 2
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBfmlexpr  //$a  :  .*/\e(.*\e)\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The addition of the \fB//\fR characters eliminates any ambiguity about the
division operator (because it makes it impossible for the left-hand
expression to be interpreted as the division operator), and simplifies the
whole expression.

.LP
\fBExample 4 \fRCounting characters in a variable
.sp
.LP
Return the number of characters in \fB$VAR:\fR

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBfmlexpr $VAR : .*\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH EXIT STATUS

In the case of syntax errors and non-numeric arguments, an error message
will be printed at the current cursor position. Use \fBrefresh\fR to redraw
the screen.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
After argument processing by \fBFMLI,\fR \fBfmlexpr\fR cannot tell the
difference between an operator and an operand except by the value. If
\fB$a\fR is an \fB=\fR, the command:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBfmlexpr $a = =\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
looks like:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBfmlexpr = = =\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
as the arguments are passed to \fBfmlexpr\fR (and they will all be taken as
the \fB=\fR operator). The following works, and returns TRUE:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBfmlexpr X$a = X=\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp
