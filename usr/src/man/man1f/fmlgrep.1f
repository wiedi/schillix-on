.SH NAME
fmlgrep \- search a file for a pattern
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBfmlgrep\fR [\fB-b\fR] [\fB-c\fR] [\fB-i\fR] [\fB-l\fR] [\fB-n\fR] [\fB-s\fR] [\fB-v\fR]

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBfmlgrep\fR searches \fIfilename\fR for a pattern and prints all lines
that contain that pattern. \fBfmlgrep\fR uses limited regular expressions
(expressions that have string values that use a subset of the possible
alphanumeric and special characters) like those described on the
\fBregexp\fR(5) manual page to match the patterns. It uses a compact
non-deterministic algorithm.
.sp
.LP
Be careful when using  \fBFMLI\fR special characters (for instance, \fB$,
`, ', "\fR) in \fIlimited_regular_expression\fR. It is safest to enclose the
entire \fIlimited_regular_expression\fR in single quotes \fB\&' ...
\&'\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIfilename\fR is not specified, \fBfmlgrep\fR assumes standard input.
Normally, each line matched is copied to standard output. The file name is
printed before each line matched if there is more than one input file.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Precede each line by the block number on which it was found. This can be
useful in locating block numbers by context (first block is 0).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Print only a count of the lines that contain the pattern.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Ignore upper/lower case distinction during comparisons.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Print only the names of files with matching lines, separated by new-lines.
Does not repeat the names of files when the pattern is found more than
once.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Precede each line by its line number in the file (first line is 1).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Print all lines except those that contain the pattern.
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
if the pattern is found (that is, \fBTRUE\fR)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB1\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
if the pattern is not found (that is, \fBFALSE\fR)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB2\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
if an invalid expression was used or \fIfilename\fR is inaccessible

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Lines are limited to  \fBBUFSIZ\fR characters; longer lines are truncated.
\fBBUFSIZ\fR is defined in \fB/usr/include/stdio.h\fR.
.sp
.LP
If there is a line with embedded nulls, \fBfmlgrep\fR will only match up to
the first null; if it matches, it will print the entire line.
