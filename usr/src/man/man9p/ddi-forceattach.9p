.SH NAME
ddi-forceattach, ddi-no-autodetach \- properties controlling driver
attach/detach behavior
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Solaris device drivers are attached by  \fBdevfsadm\fR(1M) and by the
kernel in response to
.BR open (2)
requests from applications. Drivers not
currently in use can be detached when the system experiences memory
pressure. The \fBddi-forceattach\fR and
.B ddi-no-autodetach
properties
can be used to customize driver attach/detach behavior.
.sp
.LP
The \fBddi-forceattach\fR is an integer property, to be set globally by
means of the
.BR driver.conf (4)
file. Drivers with this property set to 1
are loaded and attached to all possible instances during system startup. The
driver will not be auto-detached due to system memory pressure.
.sp
.LP
The
.B ddi-no-autodetach
is an integer property to be set globally by
means of the
.BR driver.conf (4)
file or created dynamically by the driver
on a per-instance basis with
.BR ddi_prop_update_int (9F).
When this
property is set to 1, the kernel will not auto-detach driver due to system
memory pressure.
.sp
.LP
Note that \fBddi-forceattach\fR implies
.BR ddi-no-autodetach .
Setting
either property to a non-integer value or an integer value not equal to 1
produces undefined results. These properties do not prevent driver detaching
in response to reconfiguration requests, such as executing commands
\fBcfgadm\fR(1M), \fBmodunload\fR(1M), \fBrem_drv\fR(1M), and
.BR update_drv (1M).
