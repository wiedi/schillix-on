.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B endwin()
function restores the terminal after Curses activity by
at least restoring the saved shell terminsl mode, flushing any output to the
terminal, and  moving the cursor to the first column of the last line of the
screen. Refreshing a window resumes program mode. The application must call
.B endwin()
for each terminal being used before exiting. If
.BR newterm (3XCURSES)
is called more than once for the same terminal, the
first screen created must be the last one for which
.B endwin()
is
called.
.sp
.LP
The
.B isendiwin()
function indicates whether or not a screen has been
refreshed since the last call to
.BR endwin() .
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the
.B endwin()
function returns
.BR OK .
Otherwise, it returns
.BR ERR .
.sp
.LP
The
.B isendwin()
function returns
.B TRUE
if
.B endwin()
has been
called without any subsequent refresh. Otherwise, it returns
.BR FALSE .
.SH ERRORS
