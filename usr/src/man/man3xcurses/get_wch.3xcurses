.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B get_wch()
and
.B wget_wch()
functions get a wide character
from the terminal associated with the window
.B stdscr
or window
.IR win ,
respectively. The
.B mvget_wch()
and
.BR mvwget_wch()
functions move the cursor to  the position specified in
.B stdscr
or
.IR win ,
respectively, then get a character.
.sp
.LP
If the window is not a pad and has been changed since the last call to
\fBrefresh\fR(3XCURSES), \fBget_wch()\fR calls \fBrefresh()\fR to update the
window before the next character is read.
.sp
.LP
The setting of certain functions affects the behavior of the
\fBget_wch()\fR set of functions. For example, if \fBcbreak\fR(3XCURSES) is
set, characters typed by the user are  immediately processed. If
\fBhalfdelay\fR(3XCURSES) is set, \fBget_wch()\fR waits until a character is
typed or returns
.B ERR
if no character is typed within the specified
timeout period.  This timeout can also be specified for individual windows
with the
.I delay
parameter of
.BR timeout "(3XCURSES) A negative value"
waits for input; a value of
.B 0
returns
.B ERR
if no input is ready;
a positive value blocks until input arrives or the time  specified expires
(in which case
.B ERR
is returned). If
.BR nodelay (3XCURSES)
is set,
\fBERR\fR is returned if no input is waiting;  if not set, \fBget_wch()\fR
waits until input arrives.  Each character will be echoed to the window
unless
.BR noecho "(3XCURSES) has been set."
.sp
.LP
If keypad handling is enabled (
.BR keypad (3XCURSES)
is
.BR TRUE ),
the
token for the function key (a
.B KEY_
value) is stored in the object
pointed to by
.I ch
and
.B KEY_CODE_YES
is returned. If a character is
received that could be the beginning of a function key (for example, ESC),
an inter-byte timer is set.  If the remainder of the sequence is not
received before the time expires,  the character is passed through;
otherwise, the value of the function key is returned.  If \fBnotimeout()\fR
is set, the inter-byte timer is not used.
.sp
.LP
The ESC key is typically a prefix key used with function keys and should
not be used as a single character.
.sp
.LP
See the  \fBgetch\fR(3XCURSES) manual page for a list of tokens for
function keys that  are returned by the
.B get_wch()
set of functions if
keypad handling is  enabled (Some terminals may not support all tokens).
