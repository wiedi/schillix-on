.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtouchwin()\fR function marks the entire window as dirty. This makes
it appear to X/Open Curses as if the whole window has been changed, thus
causing the entire window to be rewritten with the next call to
\fBrefresh\fR(3XCURSES). This is sometimes necessary when using overlapping
windows; the change to one window will not be reflected in the other and,
hence will not be recorded.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtouchline()\fR function marks as dirty a portion of the window
starting at line \fIstart\fR and continuing for \fIcount\fR lines instead of
the entire window. Consequently, that portion of the window is updated with
the next call to \fBrefresh()\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBuntouchwin()\fR function marks all lines in the window as unchanged
since the last refresh, ensuring that it is not updated.
.sp
.LP
The \fBwtouchln()\fR function marks \fIn\fR lines starting at line \fIy\fR
as either changed (\fIchanged\fR=1) or unchanged (\fIchanged\fR=0) since the
last refresh.
.sp
.LP
To find out which lines or windows have been changed since the last
refresh, use the \fBis_linetouched()\fR and \fBis_wintouched()\fR functions,
respectively. These return \fBTRUE\fR if the specified line or window have
been changed since the last call to \fBrefresh()\fR or \fBFALSE\fR if no
changes have been made.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
On success, these functions return \fBOK\fR. Otherwise, they return
\fBERR\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
None.
