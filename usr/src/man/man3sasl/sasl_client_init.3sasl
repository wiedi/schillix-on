.SH NAME
sasl_client_init \- initialize SASL client authentication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcc\fR [ \fIflag\fR ... ] \fIfile\fR ... \fB-lsasl\fR   [ \fIlibrary\fR ... ]
#include <sasl/sasl.h>

\fBint\fR \fBsasl_client_init\fR(\fBconst sasl_callback_t *\fIcallbacks\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Use the \fBsasl_client_init()\fR interface to initialize SASL. The
\fBsasl_client_init()\fR interface must be called before any calls to
\fBsasl_client_start\fR(3SASL). The call to \fBsasl_client_init()\fR
initiallizes all SASL client drivers, for example, authentication
mechanisms. SASL client drivers are usually found in the \fB/usr/lib/sasl\fR
directory.
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIcallbacks\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Specifies the base callbacks for all client connections.
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBsasl_client_init()\fR returns an integer that corresponds to a SASL
error code.
.SH ERRORS
.sp

All other error codes indicate an error situation that must be handled, or
the authentication session should be quit. See \fBsasl_errors\fR(3SASL) for
information on SASL error codes.
