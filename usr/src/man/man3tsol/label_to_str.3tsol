.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBlabel_to_str()\fR is a simple function to convert various mandatory
label types to human readable strings.
.sp
.LP
\fIlabel\fR is the mandatory label to convert. \fIstring\fR points to
memory that is allocated by \fBlabel_to_str()\fR that contains the converted
string. The caller is responsible for calling \fBfree\fR(3C) to free
allocated memory.
.sp
.LP
The calling process must have mandatory read access to the resulting human
readable string. Or the calling process must have the \fBsys_trans_label\fR
privilege.
.sp
.LP
The \fIconversion_type\fR parameter controls the type of label conversion.
Not all types of conversion are valid for all types of label:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBM_LABEL\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
Converts \fIlabel\fR to a human readable string based on its type.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBM_INTERNAL\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
Converts \fIlabel\fR to an internal text representation that is safe for
storing in a public object. Internal conversions can later be parsed to
their same value.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBM_COLOR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
Converts \fIlabel\fR to a string that represents the color name that the
administrator has associated with the label.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBPRINTER_TOP_BOTTOM\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
Converts \fIlabel\fR to a human readable string that is appropriate for use
as the top and bottom label of banner and trailer pages in the Defense
Intelligence Agency (DIA) encodings printed output schema.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBPRINTER_LABEL\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
Converts \fIlabel\fR to a human readable string that is appropriate for use
as the banner page downgrade warning in the DIA encodings printed output
schema.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBPRINTER_CAVEATS\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
Converts \fIlabel\fR to a human readable string that is appropriate for use
as the banner page caveats section in the DIA encodings printed output
schema.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBPRINTER_CHANNELS\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
Converts \fIlabel\fR to a human readable string that is appropriate for use
as the banner page handling channels in the DIA encodings printed output
schema.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fIflags\fR parameter provides a hint to the label conversion:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBDEF_NAMES\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
The default names are preferred.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBSHORT_NAMES\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Short names are preferred where defined.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBLONG_NAMES\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Long names are preferred.
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBlabel_to_str()\fR function returns 0.
Otherwise, -1 is returned, \fIerrno\fR is set to indicate the error and the
string pointer is set to \fINULL\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBlabel_to_str()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEINVAL\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Invalid parameter.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBENOTSUP\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
The system does not support label translations.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBENOMEM\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
The physical limits of the system are exceeded by size bytes of memory
which cannot be allocated.

The \fBlabel_to_str()\fR function is Committed. The returned string is
Not-an-Interface and is dependent on the specific \fBlabel_encodings\fR
file. The conversion type \fBINTERNAL\fR is Uncommitted, but is always
accepted as input to \fBstr_to_label\fR(3TSOL).
.sp
.LP
Conversion types that are relative to the DIA encodings schema are
Standard. Standard is specified in \fBlabel_encodings\fR(4).

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
A number of these conversions rely on the DIA label encodings schema. They
might not be valid for other label schemata.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The functionality described on this manual page is available only if the
system is configured with Trusted Extensions.
