The man pages contain a lot of unwanted cruft that is a result
from an automated troff -> sgml -> troff conversion done by Sun.

We did already convert the content of the man pages back to lines
with acceptable length whereever this is possible with an automated
conversion.

The following unwanted stuff is still in the man pages:

-	Indented paragraphes are manually indented far too much.
	This results in hard to read indented paragraphs.
	This bug typically appears together with a list of hanging
	tags. Such a list can only be converted back at a whole.

-	Instead of using:

	.br
	.ne 3
	.TP
	.B tag1
	paragraph 1
	.br
	.ne 3
	.TP
	.B tag2
	paragraph 2

	the man pages contain:

	.sp
	.ne 2
	.mk
	.na
	\fBtag1\fR
	.ad
	.RS 23n
	paragraph 1
	.RE

	.sp
	.ne 2
	.mk
	.na
	\fBtag2\fR
	.ad
	.RS 23n
	paragraph 2
	.RE

	This gives a much worse readability.

-	Instead of using the official macros for switching to
	bold or italic text, like:

	.B
	.I
	.BR
	.BI
	.RB
	.IB

	The text from Sun contains hard to read \fB, \fI \fR escape
	sequences in the text.

-	The ellipsis .\|.\|. if frequently replaced by ...
	This looks different in troff output.

-	A lot of man pages did contain constructs like:

	.if t text one
	.if n text two

	for better readability, e.g. special type-stting characters
	in the troff case and a textual transcription in the nroff
	case. This has been lost from applying the conversions by Sun.

As an example, the man page man(5) in the file man5/man.5 has been converted
to use the official structuring conventions again. Note that man(5) contains
a description of the official man page structuring conventions.
