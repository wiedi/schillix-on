.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdbm()\fR library has been superseded by \fBndbm\fR (see
\fBndbm\fR(3C)).
.sp
.LP
These functions maintain key/content pairs in a data base. The functions
will handle very large (a billion blocks) databases and will access a keyed
item in one or two file system accesses.
.sp
.LP
\fIkey/dat\fR and their content are described by the \fBdatum\fR
\fBtypedef\fR. A \fBdatum\fR specifies a string of \fIdsize\fR bytes pointed
to by \fIdptr\fR. Arbitrary binary data, as well as normal ASCII strings,
are allowed. The data base is stored in two files. One file is a directory
containing a bit map and has \fB\&.dir\fR as its suffix. The second file
contains all data and has \fB\&.pag\fR as its suffix.
.sp
.LP
Before a database can be accessed, it must be opened by \fBdbminit()\fR. At
the time of this call, the files \fIfile\fB\&.dir\fR and
\fIfile\fB\&.pag\fR must exist. An empty database is created by creating
zero-length \fB\&.dir\fR and \fB\&.pag\fR files.
.sp
.LP
A database may be closed by calling \fBdbmclose()\fR. You must close a
database before opening a new one.
.sp
.LP
Once open, the data stored under a key is accessed by \fBfetch()\fR and
data is placed under a key by \fBstore\fR. A key (and its associated
contents) is deleted by \fBdelete()\fR. A linear pass through all keys in a
database may be made, in an (apparently) random order, by use of
\fBfirstkey()\fR and \fBnextkey()\fR. \fBfirstkey()\fR will return the first
key in the database. With any key \fBnextkey()\fR will return the next key
in the database. This code will traverse the data base:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
for (key = firstkey; key.dptr != NULL; key = nextkey(key))
.fi
.in -2

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
All functions that return an \fBint\fR indicate errors with negative
values. A zero return indicates no error. Routines that return a \fBdatum\fR
indicate errors with a \fINULL\fR (0) \fIdptr\fR.
.SH SEE ALSO
.sp
.LP
\fBar\fR(1), \fBcat\fR(1), \fBcp\fR(1), \fBtar\fR(1), \fBndbm\fR(3C)
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Use of these interfaces should be restricted to only applications written
on BSD platforms.  Use of these interfaces with any of the system libraries
or in multi-thread applications is unsupported.
.sp
.LP
The \fB\&.pag\fR file will contain holes so that its apparent size may be
larger than its actual content. Older versions of the UNIX operating system
may create real file blocks for these holes when touched. These files cannot
be copied by normal means ( \fBcp\fR(1), \fBcat\fR(1), \fBtar\fR(1),
\fBar\fR(1)) without filling in the holes.
.sp
.LP
\fIdptr\fR pointers returned by these subroutines point into static storage
that is changed by subsequent calls.
.sp
.LP
The sum of the sizes of a key/content pair must not exceed the internal
block size (currently 1024 bytes). Moreover all key/content pairs that hash
together must fit on a single block. \fBstore\fR will return an error in the
event that a disk block fills with inseparable data.
.sp
.LP
\fBdelete()\fR does not physically reclaim file space, although it does
make it available for reuse.
.sp
.LP
The order of keys presented by \fBfirstkey()\fR and \fBnextkey()\fR depends
on a hashing function, not on anything interesting.
.sp
.LP
There are no interlocks and no reliable cache flushing; thus concurrent
updating and reading is risky.
.sp
.LP
The database files (\fIfile\fB\&.dir\fR and \fIfile\fB\&.pag\fR) are
binary and are architecture-specific (for example, they depend on the
architecture's byte order.)  These files are not guaranteed to be portable
across architectures.
