.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/ucb/cc\fR [ \fIflag\fR ... ] \fIfile\fR ...
#include <sys/param.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtimes()\fR function returns time-accounting information for the current process and for the terminated child processes of the current process.  All times are reported in clock ticks. The number of clock ticks per second is defined by the variable \fBCLK_TCK\fR, found in the header \fB<limits.h>\fR.
.sp
.LP
A structure with the following members is returned by \fBtimes()\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
time_t	tms_utime;    /* user time */
time_t	tms_stime;    /* system time */ 	
time_t	tms_cutime;   /* user time, children */
time_t	tms_cstime;   /* system time, children */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The children's times are the sum of the children's process times and their children's times.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBtimes()\fR returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise, it returns \fB\(mi1\fR\&.
.SH SEE ALSO

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Use of these interfaces should be restricted to only applications written on BSD platforms.  Use of these interfaces with any of the system libraries or in multi-threaded applications is unsupported.
.sp

The \fBtimes()\fR function has been superseded by \fBgetrusage\fR(3C).
