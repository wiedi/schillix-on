.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBmctl()\fR applies a variety of control functions over pages identified by the mappings established for the address range [\fIaddr, addr + len\fR). The function to be performed is identified by the argument \fIfunction\fR. Valid functions are defined in  \fB<mman.h>\fR as follows:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBMC_LOCK\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Lock the pages in the range in memory.  This function is used to support \fBmlock()\fR. See \fBmlock\fR(3C) for semantics and usage. \fIarg\fR is ignored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBMC_LOCKAS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Lock the pages in the address space in memory.  This function is used to support \fBmlockall()\fR. See \fBmlockall\fR(3C) for semantics and usage. \fIaddr\fR and \fIlen\fR are ignored. \fIarg\fR is an integer built from the flags:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBMCL_CURRENT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Lock current mappings
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBMCL_FUTURE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Lock future mappings
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBMC_SYNC\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Synchronize the pages in the range with their backing storage. Optionally invalidate cache copies. This function is used to support \fBmsync()\fR. See \fBmsync\fR(3C) for semantics and usage. \fIarg\fR is used to represent the \fIflags\fR argument to  \fBmsync()\fR. It is constructed from an OR of the following values:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBMS_SYNC\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Synchronized write
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBMS_ASYNC\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Return immediately
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBMS_INVALIDATE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Invalidate mappings
.RE

\fBMS_ASYNC\fR returns after all \fBI/O\fR operations are scheduled. \fBMS_SYNC\fR does not return until all \fBI/O\fR operations are complete. Specify exactly one of \fBMS_ASYNC\fR or \fBMS_SYNC\fR. \fBMS_INVALIDATE\fR invalidates all cached copies of data from memory, requiring them to be re-obtained from the object's permanent storage location upon the next reference.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBMC_UNLOCK\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Unlock the pages in the range. This function is used to support \fBmunlock()\fR. \fIarg\fR is ignored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBMC_UNLOCKAS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Remove address space memory lock, and locks on all current mappings. This function is used to support  \fBmunlockall()\fR. \fIaddr\fR and \fIlen\fR must have the value 0. \fIarg\fR is ignored.
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBmctl()\fR returns \fB0\fR on success, \fB\(mi1\fR on failure.
.SH ERRORS
