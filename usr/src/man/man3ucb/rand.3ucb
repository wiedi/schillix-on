.SH NAME
rand, srand \- simple random number generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/ucb/cc\fR [ \fIflag\fR .\|.\|. ] \fIfile\fR .\|.\|.

int \fBrand\fR();
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBsrand\fR(\fIseed\fR)
\fBunsigned\fR \fIseed\fR;
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBrand()\fR uses a multiplicative congruential random number generator
with period 2^32 to return successive pseudo-random numbers in the range
from 0 to 2^31 \(mi\|1.
.sp
.LP
\fBsrand()\fR can be called at any time to reset the random-number
generator to a random starting point. The generator is initially seeded with
a value of 1.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Use of these interfaces should be restricted to only applications written
on BSD platforms.  Use of these interfaces with any of the system libraries
or in multi-thread applications is unsupported.
.sp
.LP
The spectral properties of
.B rand()
leave a great deal to be desired.
.BR drand48 (3C)
and
.BR random "(3C) provide much better, though more"
elaborate, random-number generators.
.sp
.LP
The low bits of the numbers generated are not very random; use the middle
bits. In particular the lowest bit alternates between 0 and 1.
