.SH NAME
nlist \- get entries from symbol table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/ucb/cc\fR [ \fIflag\fR ... ] \fIfile\fR ...
#include <nlist.h>

\fBint\fR \fBnlist\fR(\fIfilename\fR, \fInl\fR)
\fBchar *\fR\fIfilename\fR;
\fBstruct nlist *\fR\fInl\fR;
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBnlist()\fR examines the symbol table from the executable image whose name is pointed to by \fIfilename\fR, and selectively extracts a list of values and puts them in the array of \fBnlist\fR structures pointed to by \fInl\fR. The name list pointed to by \fInl\fR consists of an array of structures containing names, types and values. The \fBn_name\fR field of each such structure is taken to be a pointer to a character string representing a symbol name. The list is terminated by an entry with a \fINULL\fR pointer (or a pointer to a \fINULL\fR string) in the \fBn_name\fR field. For each entry in \fInl\fR, if the named symbol is present in the executable image's symbol table, its value and type are placed in the \fBn_value\fR and \fBn_type\fR fields. If a symbol cannot be located, the corresponding \fBn_type\fR field of \fInl\fR is set to zero.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon normal completion, \fBnlist()\fR returns the number of symbols that were not located in the symbol table. If an error occurs, \fBnlist()\fR returns \(mi1 and sets all of the \fBn_type\fR fields in members of the array pointed to by \fInl\fR to zero.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Use of these interfaces should be restricted to only applications written on BSD platforms.  Use of these interfaces with any of the system libraries or in multi-thread applications is unsupported.
.sp
.LP
Only the \fBn_value\fR field is compatibly set.  Other fields in the \fBnlist\fR structure are filled with the ELF (Executable and Linking Format)  values (see  \fBnlist\fR(3ELF) and  \fBa.out\fR(4)).
