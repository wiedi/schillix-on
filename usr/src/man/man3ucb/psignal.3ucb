.SH NAME
psignal, sys_siglist \- system signal messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/ucb/cc\fR [ \fIflag\fR .\|.\|. ] \fIfile\fR .\|.\|.

\fBvoid\fR \fBpsignal\fR(\fIsig\fR, \fIs\fR)
\fBunsigned\fR \fIsig\fR;
\fBchar *\fIs\fR;
\fBchar *\fIsys_siglist\fR[];
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpsignal()\fR produces a short message on the standard error file
describing the indicated signal. First the argument string
.I s
is
printed, then a colon, then the name of the signal and a
.B NEWLINE.
Most
usefully, the argument string is the name of the program which incurred the
signal. The signal number should be from among those found in
.BR <signal.h> .
.sp
.LP
To simplify variant formatting of signal names, the vector of message
strings
.B sys_siglist
is provided; the signal number can be used as an
index in this table to get the signal name without the newline. The define
\fBNSIG\fR defined in \fB<signal.h>\fR is the number of messages provided
for in the table; it should be checked because new signals may be added to
the system before they are added to the table.
