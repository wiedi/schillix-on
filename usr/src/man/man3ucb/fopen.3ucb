.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfopen()\fR function opens the file specified by \fIfile\fR and associates a stream with it. If the open succeeds, \fBfopen()\fR returns a pointer to be used to identify the stream in subsequent operations. The \fIfile\fR argument points to a character string that contains the name of the file to be opened. The \fImode\fR argument is a character string having one of the following values:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBr\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
open for reading
.RE

.LP
The \fBfreopen()\fR function opens the file specified by \fIfile\fR and associates the stream pointed to by \fIiop\fR with it. The \fImode\fR argument is used just as in \fBfopen()\fR. The original stream is closed, regardless of whether the open ultimately succeeds. If the open succeeds, \fBfreopen()\fR returns the original value of \fIiop\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfreopen()\fR function is typically used to attach the pre-opened streams associated with\fBstdin\fR, \fBstdout\fR, and \fBstderr\fR to other files.
.sp
.LP
When a file is opened for update, both input and output can be performed on the resulting stream. Output cannot be directly followed by input without an intervening \fBfseek\fR(3C) or \fBrewind\fR(3C). Input cannot be directly followed by output without an intervening \fBfseek\fR(3C) or \fBrewind\fR(3C). An input operation that encounters  \fBEOF will fail.\fR
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBfopen()\fR and \fBfreopen()\fR functions return a \fINULL\fR pointer on failure.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBfopen()\fR and \fBfreopen()\fR functions have transitional interfaces for 64-bit file offsets.  See \fBlf64\fR(5).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Use of these functions should be restricted to applications written on BSD platforms.  Use of these functions with any of the system libraries or in multithreaded applications is unsupported.
.sp
.LP
To support the same number of open files as the system, \fBfopen()\fR must allocate additional memory for data structures using \fBmalloc\fR(3C) after 64 files have been opened. This confuses some programs that use their own memory allocators.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfopen()\fR and  \fBfreopen()\fR functions differ from the standard I/O functions \fBfopen\fR(3C) and \fBfreopen\fR(3C). The standard I/O functions distinguish binary from text files with an additional use of '\fBb\fR' as part of the \fImode\fR, enabling portability of \fBfopen\fR(3C) and \fBfreopen\fR(3C) beyond SunOS  4.\fIx\fR systems.
