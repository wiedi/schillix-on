.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBscandir()\fR function reads the directory \fIdirname\fR and builds
an array of pointers to directory entries using \fBmalloc\fR(3C). The second
parameter is a pointer to an array of structure pointers. The third
parameter is a pointer to a routine which is called with a pointer to a
directory entry and should return a non zero value if the directory entry
should be included in the array. If this pointer is \fINULL\fR, then all the
directory entries will be included. The last argument is a pointer to a
routine which is passed to \fBqsort\fR(3C), which sorts the completed array.
If this pointer is \fINULL\fR, the array is not sorted.
.sp
.LP
The \fBalphasort()\fR function sorts the array alphabetically.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBscandir()\fR function returns the number of entries in the array and
a pointer to the array through the parameter \fInamelist\fR. The
\fBscandir()\fR function returns \fB\(mi1\fR if the directory cannot be
opened for reading or if \fBmalloc\fR(3C) cannot allocate enough memory to
hold all the data structures.
.sp
.LP
The \fBalphasort()\fR function returns an integer greater than, equal to,
or less than 0 if the directory entry name pointed to by \fId1\fR is greater
than, equal to, or less than the directory entry name pointed to by
\fId2\fR.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBscandir()\fR and \fBalphasort()\fR functions have transitional
interfaces for 64-bit file offsets. See \fBlf64\fR(5).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Use of these functions should be restricted to applications written on
\fBBSD\fR platforms.  Use of these functions with any of the system
libraries or in multithreaded applications is unsupported.
