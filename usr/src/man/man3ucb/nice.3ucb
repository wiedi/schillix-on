.SH NAME
nice \- change priority of a process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/ucb/cc\fR [ \fIflag\fR .\|.\|. ] \fIfile\fR .\|.\|.
#include<unistd.h>

\fBint\fR \fBnice\fR(\fIincr\fR)
\fBint\fR \fIincr\fR;
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The scheduling priority of the process is augmented by \fIincr\fR. Positive
priorities get less service than normal. Priority 10 is recommended to users
who wish to execute long-running programs without undue impact on system
performance.
.sp
.LP
Negative increments are illegal, except when specified by the privileged
user. The priority is limited to the range \(mi20 (most urgent) to 20
(least). Requests for values above or below these limits result in the
scheduling priority being set to the corresponding limit.
.sp
.LP
The priority of a process is passed to a child process by \fBfork\fR(2). For
a privileged process to return to normal priority from an unknown state,
\fBnice()\fR should be called successively with arguments \(mi40 (goes to
priority \(mi20 because of truncation), 20 (to get to 0), then 0 (to maintain
compatibility with previous versions of this call).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBnice()\fR returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise, a value
of \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The priority is not changed if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEPERM\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
The value of \fIincr\fR specified was negative, and the effective user
\fBID\fR is not the privileged user.
