.SH NAME
acl_trivial \- determine whether a file has a trivial ACL
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc [ \fIflag\fR\&.\|.\|. ] \fIfile\fR\&.\|.\|. \fB-lsec\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR\&.\|.\|. ]
#include <sys/acl.h>

\fBint\fR \fBacl_trivial\fR(\fBchar *\fIpath\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBacl_trivial()\fR function is used to determine whether a file has a
trivial ACL. Whether an ACL is trivial depends on the type of the ACL. A
POSIX draft ACL is trivial if it has greater than \fBMIN_ACL_ENTRIES\fR. An
NFSv4/ZFS-style ACL is trivial if it either has entries other than
\fBowner@\fR, \fBgroup@\fR, and \fBeveryone@\fR, has inheritance flags set,
or is not ordered in a manner that meets POSIX access control
requirements.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBacl_trivial()\fR returns 0 if the file's ACL
is trivial and 1 if the file's ACL is not trivial. If it could not be
determined whether a file's ACL is trivial, -1 is returned and \fBerrno\fR
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBacl_trivial()\fR function will fail if:
