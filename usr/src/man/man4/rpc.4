.SH NAME
rpc \- rpc program number data base
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/rpc\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B rpc
file is a local source containing user readable names that
can be used in place of
.B RPC
program numbers.  The
.B rpc
file can
be used in conjunction with or instead of other rpc sources, including the
\fBNIS\fR maps ``rpc.byname'' and ``rpc.bynumber'' and the \fBNIS+\fR table
``rpc''.
.sp
.LP
The rpc file has one line for each
.B RPC
program name. The line has the
following format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIname-of-the-RPC-program\fR \fIRPC-program-number\fR \fIaliases\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters. A
``\fB#\fR'' indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end
of the line are not interpreted by routines which search the file.
