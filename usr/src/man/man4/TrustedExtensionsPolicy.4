.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBTrustedExtensionsPolicy\fR is the configuration file for Trusted
Extensions X Server Extension (\fBSUN_TSOL\fR). \fBSUN_TSOL\fR provides
security policy enforcement. This enforcement is based on Mandatory Access

.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where \fIkeyword\fR can be one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBatom\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Label this atom \fBADMIN_LOW\fR, so that \fBXGetAtomName\fR(3X11)
succeeds.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBproperty\fR
.ad

For possible keyword values, see the

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
The following entry in the \fBTrustedExtensionsPolicy\fR file
polyinstantiates the \fBDtpad\fR program:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
selection Dtpad
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If the entry is missing, or commented out, the \fBDtpad\fR program is
instantiated once.
.sp
.LP
Similarly, the following entry instantiates the \fBWM_ICON_SIZE\fR property
once:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
property WM_ICON_SIZE
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If the entry is missing, or commented out, the \fBWM_ICON_SIZE\fR property
