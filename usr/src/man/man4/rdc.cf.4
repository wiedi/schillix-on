.SH NAME
rdc.cf \- Availability Suite Remote  Mirror  software  configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrdc.cf\fR is an optional configuration file that supplies the
.BR sndradm (1M)
command with details of the volume sets to be operated on.
Inrdc.cf, the volume sets and  their host locations are defined in the
following format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
post pdevice pbitmap shost sdevice sbitmap protocol mode options
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fBrdc.cf\fR fields are:
.sp

.B phost (primary host)
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Server on which the primary volume resides.

Primary volume partition to be copied. Specify only full path names (for
example, /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.B pbitmap (primary bitmap)
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Volume partition in which the bitmap  (scoreboard  logs) of  the primary
partition is stored. Specify only full path names (for example,
/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s3).

.RS 4n
Remote Mirror operating mode. Sync is the Remote Mirror mode where the
I/O operation is not confirmed as complete until the remote volume has been
updated. Async is the  other Remote Mirror mode, in which the primary host
I/O operation is confirmed as complete  before  updating the remote
volume.

.RS 4n
A consistency group name can be specified using the  g character. A disk
queue volume partition can be specified using the q character, using full
path name only (/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s5). Without the q character set will
default to  memory  base  queue.  When  running on a clustered system, a
cluster resource group tag can be specified using the C character.
.sp
These options have the following syntax:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
[g io_groupname] [q queue_volume][C ctag]
.fi
.in -2

.LP
Note -
.sp
.RS 2
When running on a cluster configuration, the cluster resource group tag is
appended to the Remote Mirror set by default.
