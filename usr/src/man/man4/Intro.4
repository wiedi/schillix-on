This section outlines the formats of various files. The C structure
declarations for the file formats are given where applicable. Usually, the
headers containing these structure declarations can be found in the
directories \fB/usr/include\fR or \fB/usr/include/sys\fR. For inclusion in C
language programs, however, the syntax \fB#include\fR <\fIfilename.h\fR> or
\fB#include\fR <\fBsys/\fR\fIfilename.h\fR> should be used.
