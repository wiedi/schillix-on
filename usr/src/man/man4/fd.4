.SH NAME
fd \- file descriptor files
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These files, conventionally called 
.BR /dev/fd/0 ,
\fB/dev/fd/1\fR,
\fB/dev/fd/2\fR, and so on, refer to files accessible through file
descriptors. If file descriptor 
.I n
is open, these two system calls
have the same effect:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBfd = open("/dev/fd/\fIn\fR",mode);
fd = dup(\fIn\fR);
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
On these files 
.BR creat (2)
is equivalent to
.BR open ,
and
.BR mode
is ignored. As with
.BR dup ,
subsequent reads or writes on  \fBfd\fR fail
unless the original file descriptor allows the operations.
.sp
.LP
For convenience in referring to standard input, standard output, and
standard error, an additional set of names is provided: 
.B /dev/stdin
is
a synonym for 
.BR /dev/fd/0 ,
\fB/dev/stdout\fR for
.BR /dev/fd/1 ,
and
\fB/dev/stderr\fR for  \fB/dev/fd/2\fR.
.SH SEE ALSO

.BR creat (2),
.BR dup (2),
.BR open (2)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.LP
.BR open (2)
returns \fB\(mi1\fR and  \fBEBADF\fR if the associated file
descriptor is not open.
