.SH NAME
ncalogd.conf \- NCA logging configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/nca/ncalogd.conf\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBncalogd.conf\fR is used to configure Solaris Network Cache and
Accelerator ("\fBNCA\fR") logging. The file contains two fields, \fBkey\fR
and
.BR value .
.sp
.LP
The
.B status
key is used to indicate if the user wants to have
\fBNCA\fR logging turned on. If the value of \fBstatus\fR key is
.BR enabled ,
then
.B NCA
logging will be turned on. If the value of the
\fBstatus\fR key is
.BR disabled ,
then
.B NCA
logging will not be
invoked. The default value is \fBdisabled\fR.
.sp
.LP
The
.B logd_path_name
key specifies the absolute pathname of the log
file. The log file must be a raw device without a filesystem or a file on a
local file system. The default value is \fB/var/nca/log\fR.
\fBlogd_path_name\fR can also contain a whitespace-delimited list of values
for multiple log files to a maximum of 16. If you specify multiple log
files, you must enclose the list in quotation marks ("). With multiple
files,
.B NCA
logging moves to the next file on the list once the file
size specified by \fBlogd_file_size\fR has been reached. When the last file
is full,
.B NCA
logging rotates back to the first file in the list. A
pointer to the current log file is stored in
.BR /var/nca/current .
.sp
.LP
The \fBlogd_file_size\fR key specifies the value of the file size, in
bytes, allowed for each log file specified in by the \fBlogd_path_name\fR
key. The default value is 1000000 bytes.
.sp
.LP
In order to implement changes to the \fBncalogd.conf\fR file, you will need
to stop and start NCA logging or reboot.
.sp
.LP
NCA stores logs in a binary format. Use the
.BR ncab2clf (1)
utility to
convert the log from a binary format to the Common Log File format.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1\fR A Sample \fBncalogd.conf\fR File
.sp
.LP
The following is a sample \fBncalogd.conf\fR file that specifies three log
files:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
#
# NCA Log Daemon Configuration File
#

status=enabled
logd_path_name="/var/nca/log1 /var/nca/log2 /var/nca/log3"
logd_file_size=1000000
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Note that there is no NCA logging daemon. Logging is performed as one of
the functions of the NCA software.
