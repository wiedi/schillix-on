The

file contains a list of the shells on the system.

For each shell a single line should be present,
consisting of the shell's path, relative to root.
.sp
.LP
A hash mark (\fB#\fR) indicates the beginning of a comment; subsequent
characters up to the end of the line are not interpreted by the routines
which search the file. Blank lines are also ignored.
