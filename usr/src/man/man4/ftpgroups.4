.SH NAME
ftpgroups \- FTP Server enhanced group access file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/ftpd/ftpgroups\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBftpgroups\fR file contains the enhanced group access information.
.sp
.LP
After login, if the \fBftpaccess\fR(4) file includes \fIprivate\fR
\fIyes\fR, the user may use the \fBSITE GROUP\fR and \fBSITE GPASS\fR
commands to specify an enhanced access group and a password for that group.
If the access group name and password are valid, the FTP Server executes
\fBsetuid\fR(2) to make the user a member of the real group listed in the
\fBftpgroups\fR file.
.sp
.LP
The format for the \fBftpgroups\fR file is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
accessgroup:encrypted_password:real_group_name
.fi
.in -2
