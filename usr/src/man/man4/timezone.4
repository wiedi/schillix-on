.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/timezone\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The timezone file contains information regarding the default timezone for
each host in a domain. Alternatively, a single default line for the entire
domain may be specified. Each entry has the format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fITimezone-name    official-host-or-domain-name\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or TAB characters. A `#'
indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of the line
are not interpreted by routines which search the file. The timezone is a
pathname relative to the directory
.BR /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo .
.sp
.LP
This file is not actually referenced by any system software; it is merely
used as a source file to construct the
.B "NIS timezone.byname"
map.
This map is read by \fBsysidtool\fR(1M) to initialize the timezone of the
client system at installation time. For more information, see the \fISolaris
Express Installation Guide: Basic Installations\fR.
.sp
.LP
The
.B timezone
file does not set the timezone environment variable
