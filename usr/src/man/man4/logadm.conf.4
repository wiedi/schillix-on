.SH NAME
logadm.conf \- configuration file for logadm command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR is the default configuration file for the log
management tool
.BR logadm "(1M). Comments are allowed using the pound"
character (\fB#\fR) and extend to the end of line. Each non-comment line has
the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIlogname\fR \fIoptions\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
where
.I logname
is the name of the entry and
.I options
are the
default command line options for the
.B logadm
command. The name of the
entry may be the same as the name of the log file, or a log file name may be
given in the options section of the entry. Long lines may be folded using a
backslash followed by a newline to continue an entry on the next line.
Single or double quotes may be used to protect spaces or alternate-style
quotes in strings.
.sp
.LP
The preferred method for changing \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR is to use the
.BR -V ,
.BR -w ,
and
.B -r
options to the
.BR logadm "(1M) command,"
which allow you to lookup an entry, write an entry, or remove an entry from
.BR /etc/logadm.conf .
.sp
.LP
A full description of how and when \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR is used and
sample entries are found in
.BR logadm (1M).
.sp
.LP
By default,
.BR logadm (1M)
works in
.BR GMT .
Therefore, all entries in
\fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR will have a \fBGMT\fR timestamp. Users can use the
\fB-l\fR option to set \fBlogadm\fR to local time.
