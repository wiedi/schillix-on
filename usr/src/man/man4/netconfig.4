.SH NAME
netconfig \- network configuration database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/netconfig\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The network configuration database, \fB/etc/netconfig\fR, is a system file
used to store information about networks that are connected to the system.
The \fBnetconfig\fR database and the routines that access it (see
\fBgetnetconfig\fR(3NSL)) are part of the Network Selection component. The
Network Selection component also includes \fBgetnetpath\fR(3NSL) routines to
provide application-specific network search paths. These routines access the
\fBnetconfig\fR database based on the environment variable \fBNETPATH\fR.
See \fBenviron\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
\fBnetconfig\fR contains an entry for each network available on the system.
Entries are separated by newlines. Fields are separated by whitespace and
occur in the order in which they are described below. Whitespace can be
embedded as ``\fB\e\fIblank\fR'' or ``\fB\e\fItab\fR''. Backslashes
may be embedded as ``\fB\e\e\fR\&''. Lines in \fB/etc/netconfig\fR that
begin with a \fB#\fR (hash) in column 1 are treated as comments.
.sp
.LP
Each of the valid lines in the \fBnetconfig\fR database correspond to an
available transport. Each entry is of the form:
.sp

\fInetwork ID\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
A string used to uniquely identify a network. \fInetwork ID\fR consists of
non-null characters, and has a length of at least 1. No maximum length is
specified. This namespace is locally significant and the local system
administrator is the naming authority. All \fInetwork ID\fRs on a system
must be unique.

The \fIsemantics\fR field is a string identifying the ``semantics'' of the
network, that is, the set of services it supports, by identifying the
service interface it provides. The \fIsemantics\fR field is mandatory. The
following semantics are recognized.

The \fIflag\fR field records certain two-valued (``true'' and ``false'')
attributes of networks. \fIflag\fR is a string composed of a combination of
characters, each of which indicates the value of the corresponding
attribute. If the character is present, the attribute is ``true.'' If the
character is absent, the attribute is ``false.'' ``\fB-\fR'' indicates that
none of the attributes are present. Only one character is currently
recognized:

\fIprotocol family\fR

.RS 25n

The \fIprotocol family\fR and \fIprotocol name\fR fields are provided for
protocol-specific applications. The \fIprotocol family\fR field contains a
string that identifies a protocol family. The \fIprotocol family\fR
identifier follows the same rules as those for \fInetwork ID\fRs; the string
consists of non-null characters, it has a length of at least \fB1\fR, and
there is no maximum length specified. A ``\fB\(mi\fR\&'' in the \fIprotocol
family\fR field indicates that no protocol family identifier applies (the
network is experimental). The following are examples:

The \fIprotocol name\fR field contains a string that identifies a protocol.
The \fIprotocol name\fR identifier follows the same rules as those for
\fInetwork ID\fRs; that is, the string consists of non-NULL characters, it
has a length of at least \fB1\fR, and there is no maximum length specified.

\fItranslation libraries\fR
.ad
.RS 25n

The \fIname-to-address translation libraries\fR support a ``directory
service'' (a name-to-address mapping service) for the network. A
``\fB\(mi\fR\&'' in this field indicates the absence of any \fItranslation
libraries\fR. This has a special meaning for networks of the protocol family
\fBinet :\fR its name-to-address mapping is provided by the name service
switch based on the entries for \fBhosts\fR and \fBservices\fR in
\fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4). For networks of other families, a ``\fB\(mi\fR\&''
indicates non-functional name-to-address mapping. Otherwise, this field
consists of a comma-separated list of pathnames to dynamically linked
libraries. The pathname of the library can be either absolute or relative.
See \fBdlopen\fR(3C).
