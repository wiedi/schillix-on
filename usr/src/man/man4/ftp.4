.SH NAME
ftp \- FTP client configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/default/ftp\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Use the \fBftp\fR file to configure the behavior of the FTP client. Lines
that begin with a hash symbol ("# ") are treated as comment  lines and are
ignored.
.SS "Behavior Directives"
.sp
.LP
The \fBftp\fR file supports the following behavior directives:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B FTP_LS_SENDS_NLST=yes | no
.ad
.RS 30n
.rt
The
.B ls
command of the ftp client sends an
.B NLST
to the FTP
Server by default. Several non-Solaris clients send
.B LIST
instead. In
order to make the Solaris \fBftp\fR client send \fBLIST\fR when the \fBls\fR
command is issued, set
.B FTP_LS_SENDS_NLST
to
.BR no .
The value of
\fBFTP_LS_SENDS_NLST\fR is \fByes\fR by default.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If the user sets a value for
.B FTP_LS_SENDS_NLST
in the user's
environment, this value will override any
.B FTP_LS_SENDS_NLST
directive
that is specified in
.BR /etc/default/ftp .
