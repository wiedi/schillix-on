.SH NAME
nca.if \- the NCA configuration file that specifies physical interfaces
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/nca/nca.if\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Specify the physical interfaces for which the Solaris Network Cache and
Accelerator ("\fBNCA\fR") feature will be configured in the \fBnca.if\fR
configuration file. List the physical interfaces in the file, one per line.
To configure
.B NCA
to listen on all physical interfaces present on the
system backed by a
.BR hostname.{interface_name} ,
then list only an
asterik ("\fB*\fR") in \fBnca.if\fR.
.sp
.LP
When the
.BR ncakmod (1)
initialization script is invoked during system
boot, it will attempt to configure each physical interface specified in the
\fBnca.if\fR file by using \fBncaconfd\fR(1M). Note that there must be an
accompanying \fBhostname.{interface_name}\fR file and an entry in
\fB/etc/hosts\fR for the contents of \fBhostname.{interface_name}\fR.
.sp
.LP
You must reboot in order to implement changes to the \fBnca.if\fR file.
