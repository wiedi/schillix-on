.SH NAME
ftpconversions \- FTP Server conversions database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/ftpd/ftpconversions\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
When the FTP Server, \fBin.ftpd\fR(1M), receives the retrieve (\fBRETR\fR)
command, if the specified file does not exist, it looks for a conversion to
change an existing file or directory of the same base name into the format
requested, subject to the \fBftpaccess\fR(4) \fBcompress\fR and \fBtar\fR
capabilities.
.sp
.LP
The conversions  and their attributes known by \fBin.ftpd\fR(1M) are stored
in an \fBASCII\fR file of the following format. Each line in the file
provides a description for a single conversion. The fields in this file are
separated by colons (:).

.LP
The \fBStrip prefix\fR and \fBAddon prefix\fR fields are not currently
supported.
.sp
.LP
The \fBStrip postfix\fR and \fBaddon postfix\fR fields are extensions to be
added to or removed from the requested \fBfilename\fR in attempting to
produce the name of an existing file or directory. When the attempt
succeeds, the FTP Server runs the external command associated with the
conversion. The magic cookie \fB%s\fR in the argument is passed to the
command, replaced with the name of the existing file or directory.
.sp
.LP
\fBExternal command\fR is the absolute pathname of a command to run
followed by the appropriate options to carry out the conversion. The
standard output of the command is sent back in response to the \fBRETR\fR
(retrieve) command. For anonymous and guest users to be able to execute the
command, it must be present in their \fBchroot'd\fR hierarchy along with any
necessary dynamic libraries.
.sp
.LP
\fBTypes\fR specifies the conversion type. The following values are
recognized: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBT_ASCII\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
ASCII transfers are allowed of a file produced by the conversion.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBT_DIR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Directories can be converted.
.RE

.sp

\fBT_REG\fR

.LP
\fBOptions\fR are checked against the \fBftpaccess\fR(4) \fBcompress\fR and
\fBtar\fR capabilities and are recorded in the \fBspecial-action-flag\fR
field that is written to the FTP Server logfile. See \fBxferlog\fR(4). The
following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBO_COMPRESS\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
conversion compresses
.RE

.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBO_UNCOMPRESS\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt

.RE

.sp
.LP
You can specify more than one option by using "\fB|\fR" to separate
options. For example, \fBO_TAR|O_COMPRESS\fR specifies that the conversion
archives and compresses.
.sp
.LP
 \fBDescription\fR is a one word description of the conversion that is used in error messages returned to the FTP client.
.sp
.LP
Lines that begin with a \fB#\fR sign are treated as comment lines and are
ignored.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRCompressing a Regular File for Transfer
.sp
.LP
The following example specifies a conversion which generates
\fBfilename.Z\fR by compressing an existing file \fBfilename\fR. The
conversion can only be applied to regular files, not directories, and the
absence of \fBT_ASCII\fR prevents the resulting file from being transferred
in ASCII mode.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
: : :.Z:/usr/bin/compress -c %s:T_REG:O_COMPRESS:COMPRESS
.fi
.in -2

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fR Uncompressing and Transferring in ASCII Mode
.sp
.LP
The following example specifies a conversion that takes \fBfilename.Z\fR
and uncompresses it to produce \fBfilename\fR, which then can be transferred
in ASCII mode.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
:.Z: : :/usr/bin/compress -cd %s:T_REG|T_ASCII:O_UNCOMPRESS:UNCOMPRESS
.fi
