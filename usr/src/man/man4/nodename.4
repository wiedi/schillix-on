.SH NAME
nodename \- local source for system name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/nodename\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
When a machine is standalone or its IP address is configured locally, the
\fB/etc/nodename\fR file contains the system name. By convention, the system
name is the same as the hostname associated with the IP address of the
primary network interface, for example, \fBhostname.hme0\fR.
.sp
.LP
If the machine's network configuration is delivered by the RPC bootparams
protocol, the
.B /etc/nodename
file is not used, as the system name is
delivered by the remote service.
.sp
.LP
Given a system name value, regardless of source, the
.B uname
utility
invoked with the
.B -S
option is used to set the system name of the
running system.
.sp
.LP
If the machine's network configuration is delivered by the DHCP protocol,
the
.B /etc/nodename
file is used only if the DHCP server does not
provide a value for the Hostname option (DHCP standard option code 12).
.sp
.LP
A system name configured in
.B /etc/nodename
should be unique within the
system's name service domain in order to ensure that any network services
provided by the system will operate correctly.
.sp
.LP
Given a system name value, regardless of source, the
.B uname
utility
invoked with the
.B -S
option is used to set the system name of the
running system.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1\fR Syntax
.sp
.LP

.B nodename
consists of a single line containing the
system's name. For example, for a system named \fBmyhost\fR:

.sp
.in +2

myhost
.fi
.in -2
