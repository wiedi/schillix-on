.SH NAME
prototype \- package information file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
.B prototype
is an
.B ASCII
file used to specify package information.
Each entry in the file describes a single deliverable object. An object can
be a data file, directory, source file, executable object, and so forth.
This file is generated by the package developer.
.sp
.LP
Entries in a
.B prototype
file consist of several fields of information
separated by white space. Comment lines begin with a ``\fB#\fR'' and are
ignored. The fields are described below and must appear in the order
shown.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I part
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
An optional field designating the part number in which the object resides.
A part is a collection of files and is the atomic unit by which a package is
processed. A developer can choose criteria for grouping files into a part
(for example, based on class). If this field is not used, part 1 is
assumed.

.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I class
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The installation class to which the file belongs. This name can be no
longer than 64 characters. The field is not specified for installation
scripts. (\fBadmin\fR and all classes beginning with capital letters are
reserved class names.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I pathname
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The pathname where the file resides on the target machine, for example,
.B /usr/bin/mail
or
.BR bin/ras/proc .
Relative pathnames (those that do
not begin with a slash) indicate that the file is relocatable. The form
.sp
\fIpath1\fB=\fIpath2\fR
.sp
can be used for two purposes: to define a link and to define local
pathnames.
.sp
For linked files,
.I path1
indicates the destination of the link and
.I path2
indicates the source file. (This format is mandatory for linked
files.)
.sp
For local pathnames,
.I path1
indicates the pathname an object should
have on the machine where the entry is to be installed and
.IR path2
indicates either a relative or fixed pathname to a file on the host machine
which contains the actual contents.
.sp
A pathname can contain a variable specification of the form
\fB$\fIvariable.\fR If \fIvariable\fR begins with a lower case letter, it
is a build variable. If
.I variable
begins with an upper case letter, it
is an install variable. Build variables are bound at build time. If an
install variable is known at build time, its definition is inserted into the
.BR pkginfo (4)
file so that it is available at install time. If an install
variable is not known at build time, it is bound at install time.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I major
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The major device number. The field is only specified for block or character
special devices.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I minor
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The minor device number. The field is only specified for block or character
special devices.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I mode
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The octal mode of the file (for example, 0664). A question mark (\fB?\fR)
indicates that the mode is left unchanged, implying that the file already
exists on the target machine. This field is not used for linked files or
packaging information files.
.sp
The mode can be a variable specification of the form \fB$\fIvariable.\fR
If
.I variable
begins with a lower case letter, it is a build variable.
If
.I variable
begins with an upper case letter, it is an install
variable. Build variables are bound at build time. If an install variable is
known at build time, its definition is inserted into the
.BR pkginfo (4)
file so that it is available at install time. If an install variable is not
known at build time, it is bound at install time.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I owner
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The owner of the file (for example,
.B bin
or
.BR root ).
The field is
limited to 14 characters in length. A question mark (\fB?\fR) indicates that
the owner is left unchanged, implying that the file already exists on the
target machine. This field is not used for linked files or packaging
information files.
.sp
The owner can be a variable specification of the form
\fB$\fIvariable.\fR If \fIvariable\fR begins with a lower case letter, it
is a build variable. If
.I variable
begins with an upper case letter, it
is an install variable. Build variables are bound at build time. If an
install variable is known at build time, its definition is inserted into the
.BR pkginfo (4)
file so that it is available at install time. If an install
variable is not known at build time, it is bound at install time.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I group
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The group to which the file belongs (for example,
.B bin
or
.BR sys ).
The field is limited to 14 characters in length. A question mark (\fB?\fR)
indicates that the group is left unchanged, implying that the file already
exists on the target machine. This field is not used for linked files or
packaging information files.
.sp
The group can be a variable specification of the form
\fB$\fIvariable.\fR If \fIvariable\fR begins with a lower case letter, it
is a build variable. If
.I variable
begins with an upper case letter, it
is an install variable. Build variables are bound at build time. If an
install variable is known at build time, its definition is inserted into the
.BR pkginfo (4)
file so that it is available at install time. If an install
variable is not known at build time, it is bound at install time.
.RE

.sp
.LP
An exclamation point (\fB!\fR) at the beginning of a line indicates that
the line contains a command. These commands are used to incorporate files in
other directories, to locate objects on a host machine, and to set permanent
defaults. The following commands are available:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B search
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Specifies a list of directories (separated by white space) to search for
when looking for file contents on the host machine. The base name of the
.I path
field is appended to each directory in the ordered list until the
file is located. Searches are not recursive.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B include
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Specifies a pathname which points to another prototype file to include.
Note that
.B search
requests do not span
.B include
files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B default
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Specifies a list of attributes (mode, owner, and group) to be used by
default if attribute information is not provided for prototype entries which
require the information. The defaults do not apply to entries in
.B include
prototype files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIparam\fB=\fIvalue\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Places the indicated parameter in the current environment. Spans to
subsequent included prototype files.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The above commands can have variable substitutions embedded within them, as
demonstrated in the two example prototype files below.
.sp
.LP
Before files are overwritten during installation, they are copied to a
temporary pathname. The exception to this rule is files whose mode includes
execute permission, unless the file is editable (that is,
.I ftype
is
.BR e ).
For files which meet this exception, the existing version is
linked to a temporary pathname, and the original file is removed. This
allows processes which are executing during installation to be
overwritten.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Normally, if a file is defined in the
.B prototype
file but does not
exist, that file is created at the time of package installation. However, if
the file pathname includes a directory that does not exist, the file is not
created. For example, if the
.B prototype
file has the following entry:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBf none /usr/dev/bin/command\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
and that file does not exist, it is created if the directory
.B /usr/dev/bin
already exists or if the
.B prototype
also has an
entry defining the directory:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBd none /usr/dev/bin\fR
