.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB/etc/mpapi.conf\fR file is used to specify the vendor-provided
plugin library that is installed on the system. This file is used by the
.BR libMPAPI (3LIB)
common library to load the individual plugin library
when its interface is called. If changes are made to the file while the
library is in use, the library should be unloaded and reloaded. Addition and
removal of the plugin library should be handled through
.BR MP_RegisterPlugin (3MPAPI)
and
.BR MP_DeregisterPlugin (3MPAPI).
.sp
.LP
Each plugin library entry is a single line of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
"id"        "library file name"
.fi
.in -2
