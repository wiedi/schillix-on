.SH NAME
audit_user \- per-user auditing data file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/security/audit_user\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBaudit_user\fR is a database that stores per-user auditing preselection
data. You can use the \fBaudit_user\fR file with other authorization
sources, including the \fBNIS\fR map \fBaudit_user.byname\fR and the
\fBNIS+\fR table \fBaudit_user\fR. Programs use the \fBgetauusernam\fR(3BSM)
routines to access this information.
.sp
.LP
The search order for multiple user audit information sources is specified
in the \fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR file. See \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4). The lookup
follows the search order for \fBpasswd\fR(4).
.sp
.LP
The fields for each user entry are separated by colons (\fB:\fR). Each user
is separated from the next by a newline. \fBaudit_user\fR does not have
general read permission. Each entry in the \fBaudit_user\fR file has the
form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIusername\fR:\fIalways-audit-flags\fR:\fInever-audit-flags\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The fields are defined as follows:

This functionality is available only if the Basic Security Module
(\fBBSM\fR) has been enabled. See \fBbsmconv\fR(1M) for more information.

.LP
Configuration changes do not affect audit sessions that are currently
running, as the changes do not modify a process's preselection mask. To
change the preselection mask on a running process, use the \fB-setpmask\fR
option of the \fBauditconfig\fR command (see \fBauditconfig\fR(1M)). If the
user logs out and logs back in, the new configuration changes will be
reflected in the next audit session.
