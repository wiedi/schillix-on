.SH NAME
bart_manifest \- system audit manifest file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBbart\fR(1M) command generates a manifest that describes the contents
of a managed host. A manifest consists of a header and entries. Each entry
represents a single file. Entries are sorted in ascending order by file
name. Any nonstandard file names, such as those that contain embedded
newline or tab characters, have the special characters quoted prior to being
sorted. See
.BR "Quoting Syntax" .
.sp
.LP
Lines that begin with
.B !
supply metadata about the manifest. The
manifest version line indicates the manifest specification version. The date
line shows the date on which the manifest was created, in
.BR date (1)
form.
.sp
.LP
Some lines are ignored by the manifest comparison tool. Ignored lines
include blank lines, lines that consist only of white space, and comments
that begin with
.BR # .
.sp
.LP
In addition to metadata lines, the header contains the format comment
block. This comment block lists the attributes reported for each file
type.
.sp
.LP
To see the format of a manifest file, see
.BR EXAMPLES .
.SS "Manifest File Entries"
.sp
.LP
Each manifest file entry is a single line of one of the following forms,
depending on the file type:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIfname\fR D \fIsize mode acl dirmtime uid gid\fR
\fIfname\fR P \fIsize mode acl mtime uid gid\fR
\fIfname\fR S \fIsize mode acl mtime uid gid\fR
\fIfname\fR F \fIsize mode acl mtime uid gid contents\fR
\fIfname\fR L \fIsize mode acl lnmtime uid gid dest\fR
\fIfname\fR B \fIsize mode acl mtime uid gid devnode\fR
\fIfname\fR C \fIsize mode acl mtime uid gid devnode\fR

.SS "Quoting Syntax"
.sp
.LP
The rules file supports a quoting syntax for representing nonstandard file
names.
.sp
.LP
When generating a manifest for file names that embeded TAB, SPACE, or
NEWLINE characters, the special characters are encoded in their octal
forms.
