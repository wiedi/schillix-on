.SH NAME
ftpservers \- FTP Server virtual hosting configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
/etc/ftpd/ftpservers
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBftpservers\fR file is used to configure complete virtual hosting. In
contrast to limited virtual hosting, complete virtual hosting allows
separate configuration files to be specified for each virtual host.
.sp
.LP
The set of configuration files for each virtual host are placed in their
own directory. The \fBftpservers\fR file associates the address of each
virtual host with the directory its configuration files are stored in. The
virtual host configuration files must be named:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBftpaccess\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Virtual host's access file
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBftpusers\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Restricts the accounts that can use the virtual host

.sp

\fBftpgroups\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBftphosts\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Allow or deny usernames access to the virtual host
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBftpconversions\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Customize conversions available from the virtual host
.RE

.sp
.LP
You do not need to put every file in each virtual host directory. If you
want a virtual host to use the master copy of a file, then do not include it
in the virtual host directory. If the file is not included, the master copy
from the \fB/etc/ftpd\fR directory will be used.
.sp
.LP
The file names must match exactly. If you misspell any of  them or name
them differently, the server will not find them, and the server will use the
master copy instead.
.sp
.LP
The \fBftpaddhost\fR utility is an administrative tool to configure virtual
hosts. See \fBftpaddhost\fR(1M).
.SS "File Format"
.sp
.LP
There are two fields to each entry in the \fBftpservers\fR file:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
address   directory-containing-configuration-files
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
10.196.145.10    /etc/ftpd/virtual-ftpd/10.196.145.10
10.196.145.200   /etc/ftpd//virtual-ftpd/10.196.145.200
some.domain      INTERNAL
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
When an FTP client connects to the FTP Server, \fBin.ftpd\fR(1M) tries to
match the IP address to which the FTP client connected with one found in the
\fBftpservers\fR file.
.sp
.LP
The
.B address
can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address, or a hostname.
.sp
.LP
If a match is found, The FTP server uses any configuration files found in
the associated directory.
.sp
.LP
If a match is not found,  or an invalid directory path is encountered,  the
default paths to the configuration files are used. The use of \fBINTERNAL\fR
in the example above fails the check for a specific directory, and the
master configuration files will be used.
.sp
.LP
Either the actual IP address or a specific hostname can be used to specify
the virtual host. It is better to specify the actual IP of the virtual host,
as it reduces the need for a domain lookup and eliminates DNS security
related naming issues, for example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
10.196.145.20     /etc/ftpd/config/faqs.org/
ftp.some.domain   /etc/ftpd/config/faqs.org/
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Lines that begin with a
.B #
sign are treated as comment lines and are
ignored.
