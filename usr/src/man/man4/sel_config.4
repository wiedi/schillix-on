.TH sel_config 4 "20 Jul 2007" "SunOS 5.11" "File Formats"
.SH NAME
sel_config \- selection rules for copy, cut, paste, drag and drop
operations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/dt/config/sel_config\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsel_config\fR file specifies how a system that is configured with
Trusted Extensions behaves when a user transfers data between windows that
have different labels. Transfer operations include cut-and-paste,
copy-and-paste, and drag-and-drop. There are two types of entries in this
file: automatic confirmation and automatic reply.
.SS "Automatic Confirmation"
.sp
.LP
This type of entry specifies whether a confirmation window, the selection
confirmer, displays. Each entry has the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIrelationship\fR: \fIconfirmation\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\fIrelationship\fR identifies the result of comparing the selected data's
source and destination windows' labels. There are three allowed values:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBupgradesl\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
The source window's label is less than the destination window's label.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBdowngradesl\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
The source window's label is higher than the destination window's label.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBdisjointsl\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
The source and destination windows' labels are disjoint. Neither label
dominates the other.
.RE

.sp
.LP
\fIconfirmation\fR specifies whether to perform automatic confirmation.
Allowed values are:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBn\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
Use manual confirmation, that is, display the selection confirmer window.
This is the default.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBy\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
Use automatic confirmation, that is, do not display the selection confirmer
window.
.RE

.SS "Automatic Reply"
.sp
.LP
A single user operation can involve several flows of information between
the source and destination windows. The automatic reply set of entries
provides a means to reduce the number of confirmations that are required of
the user.
.sp
.LP
There must be one entry of this form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
autoreply: \fIvalue\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If \fIvalue\fR is \fBy\fR (for yes), then the remaining entries of the set
are used as attributes for the selection data (rather than the actual
contents) to complete the operation without confirmation. If \fIvalue\fR is
\fBn\fR (for no), then the remaining entries are ignored.
.sp
.LP
Defaults can be specified for any \fItype\fR field that appears in the
Confirmer window. Below are some sample entries for defaults.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
replytype: TARGETS
replytype: Pixel Sets
replytype: LENGTH
replytype: Type Of Monitor
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The \fBTARGETS\fR entry, when used, returns the list of target atoms that
are supported by the source window. The \fBPixel Sets\fR and \fBType Of
Monitor\fR entries are used for animation during a drag-and-drop operation.
The \fBLENGTH\fR entry specifies the number of bytes in the selection.
