.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B /etc/crypto/certs
directory contains ASN.1 BER or PEM encoded
certificate files for use by the Solaris Cryptographic Framework.
.sp
.LP
A default installation contains root anchors and signing certificates. The
.B CA
and
.B SUNWobjectCA
certificates are the trust anchors for all
other certificates. Other certificates contain the certificates used to sign
and verify the Solaris user and kernel cryptographic plug-ins
.sp
.LP
Additional signing certificates may be installed by third-party
cryptographic providers. They should either be copied to
.B /etc/crypto/certs
or included in the package that delivers the
provider.
.sp
.LP
Only certificates that are issued by the
.B CA
or
.BR SUNWobjectCA
certificates and include the organization unit "Solaris Cryptographic
Framework" in their subject distinguished names are accepted by the Solaris
Cryptographic Framework. This restriction is in place due to US Export Law
on the export of open cryptographic interfaces at the time of shipping this
revision of the product.
