.SH NAME
mod_ipp \- Embedded Internet Print Protocol (IPP) listener for the Apache
HTTP server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/apache/libexec/mod_ipp.so\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmod_ipp\fR module implements RFCs 2910 and 2911 to provide an IPP
handling service for the Apache HTTP server. When loaded on the Apache
server, \fBmod_ipp\fR processes all HTTP requests with MIME types of
\fBapplication/ipp\fR. The \fBmod_ipp\fR module also processes additional
configuration directives to enable or disable portions of the protocol
support.
.SS "Using Configuration Directives"

.LP
The following is a list of configuration directives that apply to the
Apache IPP Listening service:
.RS +4

The values \fBtrue\fR, \fByes\fR, \fBon\fR, \fBenable\fR are considered to
be synonymous and will enable support for the named operation. All other
values will disable support for the named operation.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Configuration file directives are processed in the order listed in the
config file. The default behavior is to enable support for all operations
implemented in the \fBmod_ipp\fR Apache module.
.sp
.LP
Since the Apache IPP listening service implements some capabilities that
are more of operator features, it may not be desirable to enable all IPP
operations without requiring user authentication on the Apache listening
service.
.sp
.LP
The following is an example of a more reasonable configuration for Apache
IPP servers without user authentication enabled:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
ipp-operations  all      disabled
ipp-operations  required enabled
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The printers and jobs available under this service can be accessed using
URIs of the following form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
printer:
                 http://server[:port]/printers/{queue}
                 ipp://server[:port]/printers/{queue}
job:
                 http://server[:port]/printers/{queue}/{job-id}
                 ipp://server[:port]/printers/{queue}/{job-id}
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
631 is the default IPP port and implied when the URI scheme is \fBipp\fR.
However, some client implementations do not recognize the \fBipp\fR URI
scheme and require \fBhttp://server:631/...\fR instead. For example,
Microsoft's IPP client implementation does not recognize the \fBipp\fR
scheme.
.sp
.LP
In addition to the documentation and man pages included with Solaris, more
information is available at http://www.apache.org
.sp
.LP
The \fBhttpd\fR(8) man page and other Apache man pages are provided with
the programming modules. To view the Apache manual pages with the man
command, add \fB/usr/apache/man\fR to the \fBMANPATH\fR environment
variable. See \fBman\fR(1) for  more information. Running \fBcatman\fR(1M)
on the Apache manual pages is not supported.
