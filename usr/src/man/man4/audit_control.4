.SH NAME
audit_control \- control information for system audit daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/security/audit_control\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B audit_control
file contains audit control information used by
.BR auditd (1M).
Each line consists of a title and a string, separated by a
colon. There are no restrictions on the order of lines in the file, although
some lines must appear only once. A line beginning with `\fB#\fR' is a
comment. A line can be continued with the use of the backslash (\fB\e\fR)
convention. (See EXAMPLES.)
.sp
.LP
Directory definition lines list the directories to be used when creating
audit files, in the order in which they are to be used. The format of a
directory line is:
.sp
.LP
\fBdir:\fIdirectory-name\fR
.sp
.LP
\fIdirectory-name\fR is where the audit files will be created. Any valid
writable directory can be specified.
.sp
.LP
The following configuration is recommended:
.sp
.LP
\fB/etc/security/audit/\fIserver\fR/files\fR
.sp
.LP
where
.I server
is the name of a central machine, since audit files
belonging to different servers are usually stored in separate subdirectories
of a single audit directory. The naming convention normally has \fIserver\fR
be a directory on a server machine, and all clients mount
\fB/etc/security/audit/\fIserver\fR at the same location in their local
file systems. If the same server exports several different file systems for
auditing, their
.I server
names will, of course, be different.
.sp
.LP
There are several other ways for audit data to be arranged: some sites may
have needs more in line with storing each host's audit data in separate
subdirectories. The audit structure used will depend on each individual
site.
.sp
.LP
The audit threshold line specifies the percentage of free space that must
be present in the file system containing the current audit file. The format
of the threshold line is:
.sp
.LP
\fBminfree:\fIpercentage\fR
.sp
.LP
where
.I percentage
is indicates the amount of free space required. If
free space falls below this threshold, the audit daemon
.BR auditd (1M)
invokes the shell script \fBaudit_warn\fR(1M). If no threshold is specified,
the default is 0%.
.sp
.LP
The
.B plugin
definition line selects a plugin to be loaded by the audit
daemon for processing audit records.
.sp
.LP
The format of a plugin line is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
plugin: \fIkeyword1\fR=\fIvalue1\fR;\fIkeyword2\fR=\fIvalue2\fR;
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The following keywords are defined:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B name
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
The value is the pathname of the plugin. This specification is required.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B qsize
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
The value is the maximum number of records to queue for audit data sent to
the plugin. If omitted, the current hiwater mark (see the
.B -getqctrl
of
\fBauditconfig\fR(1M)) is used. When this maximum is reached, \fBauditd\fR
will either block or discard data, depending on the audit policy
.BR cnt .
See
.BR auditconfig (1M).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B p_*
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
A keyword with the prefix
.B p_
is passed to the plugin defined by the
value associated with the
.B name
attribute. These attributes are defined
for each plugin. By convention, if the value associated with a \fBplugin\fR
attribute is a list, the list items are separated with commas.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If pathname is a relative path (it does not start with
.BR / )
the library
path will be taken as relative to
.BR /usr/lib/security/$ISA .
The
\fB$ISA\fR token is replaced by an implementation-defined directory name
that defines the path relative to the
.BR auditd "(1M) instruction set"
architecture.
.sp
.LP
See
.BR audit_syslog (5)
for the attributes expected for \fBplugin:
name=audit_syslog.so\fR.
.sp
.LP
No plugin specifier is required for generation of a binary audit log.
However, to set a queue size of other than the default, a plugin line with
\fBname=audit_binfile.so\fR can be used as described in
.BR audit_binfile (5).
.sp
.LP
You must specify one or more plugins. (In the case of
\fBaudit_binfile.so\fR, use of \fBdir:\fR or \fBplugin:\fR suffices.)
.sp
.LP
The audit flags line specifies the default system audit value. This value
is combined with the user audit value read from
.BR audit_user (4)
to form
a user's process preselection mask.
.sp
.LP
The algorithm for obtaining the process preselection mask is as follows:
the audit flags from the \fBflags:\fR line in the \fBaudit_control\fR file
are added to the flags from the
.B always-audit
field in the user's entry
in the
.B audit_user
file. The flags from the
.B never-audit
field
from the user's entry in the
.B audit_user
file are then subtracted from
the total:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
user's process preselection mask =
   (flags: line + always audit flags) - never audit flags
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The format of a flags line is:
.sp
.LP
\fBflags:\fIaudit-flags\fR
.sp
.LP
where \fIaudit-flags\fR specifies which event classes are to be audited.
The character string representation of \fIaudit-flags\fR contains a series
of flag names, each one identifying a single audit class, separated by
commas. A name preceded by `\fB\(mi\fR\&' means that the class should be
audited for failure only; successful attempts are not audited. A name
preceded by `\fB+\fR' means that the class should be audited for success
only; failing attempts are not audited. Without a prefix, the name indicates
that the class is to be audited for both successes and failures. The special
string
.B all
indicates that all events should be audited; \fB\(miall\fR
indicates that all failed attempts are to be audited, and
.B +all
all
successful attempts. The prefixes
.BR ^ ,
\fB^\(mi\fR, and \fB^+\fR turn
off flags specified earlier in the string (\fB^\(mi\fR and \fB^+\fR for
failing and successful attempts,
.B ^
for both). They are typically used
to reset flags.
.sp
.LP
The non-attributable flags line is similar to the flags line, but this one
contain the audit flags that define what classes of events are audited when
an action cannot be attributed to a specific user. The format of a
\fBnaflags\fR line is:
.sp
.LP
\fBnaflags:\fIaudit-flags\fR
.sp
.LP
The flags are separated by commas, with no spaces. See
.BR audit_class (4)
for a list of the predefined audit classes. Note that the classes are
configurable as also described in
.BR audit_class (4).
.sp
.LP
A line can be continued by appending a backslash (\fB\e\fR).

\fBExample 1\fR Sample \fBaudit_control\fR File for Specific Host
.sp
.LP
The following is a sample
.B /etc/security/audit_control
file for the

.BR eggplant .

.sp
.LP
The file's contents identify server
.B jedgar
with two file systems
normally used for audit data, another server,
.BR global ,
used only when
\fBjedgar\fR fills up or breaks, and specifies that the warning script is
run when the file systems are 80% filled. It also specifies that all logins,
administrative operations are to be audited, whether or not they succeed.
All failures except failures to access object attributes are to be
audited.

Shown below is a sample

by means of
.BR audit_user (4).
For syslog output, all

are output. The specification for the plugin is given in two lines.

Part\ VII, \fISolaris Auditing,\fR in \fISystem Administration Guide:
Security Services\fR
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Use of the plugin configuration line to include
.BR audit_syslog.so
requires that \fB/etc/syslog.conf\fR be configured for audit data. See
.BR audit_syslog (5)
for more details.
.sp
.LP
Configuration changes do not affect audit sessions that are currently
running, as the changes do not modify a process's preselection mask. To
.RB "change the preselection mask on a running process, use the" " -setpmask"
option of the \fBauditconfig\fR command (see \fBauditconfig\fR(1M)). If the
user logs out and logs back in, the new configuration changes will be
reflected in the next audit session.
.sp
.LP
This file is Obsolete and may be removed and replaced with equivalent
functionality in a future release of Solaris.
