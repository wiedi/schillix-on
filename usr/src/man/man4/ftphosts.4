.SH NAME
ftphosts \- FTP Server individual user host access file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/ftpd/ftphosts\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBftphosts\fR file is used to allow or deny access to accounts from
specified hosts. The following access capabilities are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBallow \fIusername\fR \fIaddrglob\fR [\fIaddrglob\fR.\|.\|.]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Only allow users to login as \fIusername\fR from host(s) that match
\fIaddrglob\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBdeny \fIusername\fR \fIaddrglob\fR [\fIaddrglob\fR.\|.\|.]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Do not allow users to login as \fIusername\fR from host(s) that match
\fIaddrglob\fR.
.RE

.sp
.LP
A \fIusername\fR of \fB*\fR matches all users. A \fIusername\fR of
\fBanonymous\fR or \fBftp\fR specifies the anonymous user.
.sp
.LP
\fIaddrglob\fR is a regular expression that is matched against hostnames or
IP addresses. \fIaddrglob\fR may also be in the form \fBaddress:netmask\fR
or \fBaddress/CIDR\fR, or be the name of a file that starts with a slash
('\fB/\fR') and contains additional address globs. An exclamation mark
(`\fB!\fR') placed before the \fBaddrglob\fR negates the test.
.sp
.LP
The first \fBallow\fR or \fBdeny\fR entry in the \fBftphosts\fR file that
matches a \fIusername\fR and host is used. If no entry exists for a
\fIusername\fR, then access is allowed. Otherwise, a matching allow entry is
required to permit access.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
You can use the following \fBftphosts\fR file to allow anonymous access
from any host except those on the class A network 10, with the exception of
\fB10.0.0.*\fR IP addresses, which are allowed access:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
allow   ftp   10.0.0.*
deny    ftp   10.*.*.*
allow   ftp   *
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
\fB10.0.0.*\fR can be written as \fB10.0.0.0:255.255.255.0\fR or
\fB10.0.0.0/24\fR.
