.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBrndc.conf\fR is the configuration file for \fBrndc\fR, the BIND 9 name
server control utility. This file has a similar structure and syntax to
\fBnamed.conf\fR. Statements are enclosed in braces and terminated with a
semi-colon. Clauses in the statements are also semi-colon terminated. The
usual comment styles are supported:

.LP
\fBrndc.conf\fR is much simpler than \fBnamed.conf\fR. The file uses three
statements: an options statement, a server statement and a key statement.
.sp
.LP
The \fBoptions\fR statement contains three clauses. The
\fBdefault-server\fR clause is followed by the name or address of a name
server. This host is used when no name server is provided as an argument to
\fBrndc\fR. The \fBdefault-key\fR clause is followed by the name of a key
which is identified by a \fBkey\fR statement. If no \fBkeyid\fR is provided
on the rndc command line, and no \fBkey\fR clause is found in a matching
\fBserver\fR statement, this default key will be used to authenticate the
server's commands and responses. The \fBdefault-port\fR clause is followed
by the port to connect to on the remote name server. If no \fBport\fR option
is provided on the rndc command line, and no \fBport\fR clause is found in a
matching \fBserver\fR statement, this default port will be used to
connect.
.sp
.LP
After the \fBserver\fR keyword, the server statement includes a string
which is the hostname or address for a name server. The statement has two
possible clauses: \fBkey\fR and \fBport\fR. The key name must match the name
of a key statement in the file. The port number specifies the port to
connect to.
.sp
.LP
The \fBkey\fR statement begins with an identifying string, the name of the
key. The statement has two clauses. \fBalgorithm\fR identifies the
encryption algorithm for \fBrndc\fR to use; currently only HMAC-MD5 is
supported. This is followed by a secret clause which contains the base-64
encoding of the algorithm's encryption key. The base-64 string is enclosed
in double quotes.
.sp
.LP
There are two common ways to generate the base-64 string for the secret.
The BIND 9 program \fBrndc-confgen\fR(1M) can be used to generate a random
key, or the \fBmmencode\fR program, also known as \fBmimencode\fR, can be
used to generate a base-64 string from known input. \fBmmencode\fR does not
ship with BIND 9 but is available on many systems. See the EXAMPLES section
for sample command lines for each.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.in +2
.nf
options {
     default-server  localhost;
     default-key     samplekey;
};

server localhost {
     key             samplekey;
};

key samplekey {
     algorithm hmac-md5;
     secret
     "c3Ryb25nIGVub3VnaCBmb3IgYSBtYW4gYnV0IG1hZGUgZm9yIGEgd29tYW4K";
};

.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In the above example, \fBrndc\fR by default uses the server at localhost
(127.0.0.1) and the key called \fIsamplekey\fR. Commands to the localhost
server use the \fIsamplekey\fR key, which must also be defined in the
server's configuration file with the same name and secret. The key statement
indicates that \fIsamplekey\fR uses the HMAC-MD5 algorithm. Its secret
clause contains the base-64 encoding of the HMAC-MD5 secret enclosed in
double quotes.
.sp
.LP
To generate a random secret with \fBrndc-confgen\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
rndc-confgen
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
A complete \fBrndc.conf\fR file, including the randomly generated key, will
be written to the standard output. Commented out \fBkey\fR and
\fBcontrols\fR statements for \fBnamed.conf\fR are also printed.
.sp
.LP
To generate a base-64 secret with \fBmmencode\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
echo "known plaintext for a secret" | mmencode
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH NAME SERVER CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The name server must be configured to accept rndc connections and to
recognize the key specified in the \fBrndc.conf\fR file, using the controls
statement in \fBnamed.conf\fR. See the sections on the \fBcontrols\fR
statement in the \fIBIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual\fR for details.
