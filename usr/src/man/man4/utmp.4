.SH NAME
utmp, wtmp \- utmp and wtmp database entry formats
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB#include <utmp.h>\fR
\fB/var/adm/utmp\fR
\fB/var/adm/wtmp\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B utmp
and
.B wtmp
database files are obsolete and are no longer
present on the system.  They have been superseded by the extended database
contained in the
.B utmpx
and
.B wtmpx
database files.  See
.BR utmpx (4).
.sp
.LP
It is possible for
.B /var/adm/utmp
to reappear on the system. This
would most likely occur if a third party application that still uses
.B utmp
recreates the file if it finds it missing. This file should not
be allowed to remain on the system. The user should investigate to determine
which application is recreating this file.
