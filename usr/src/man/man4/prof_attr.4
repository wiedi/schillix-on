.SH NAME
prof_attr \- profile description database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/security/prof_attr\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fB/etc/security/prof_attr\fR is a local source for execution profile
names, descriptions, and other attributes of execution profiles. The
\fBprof_attr\fR file can be used with other profile sources, including the
\fBprof_attr NIS\fR map and \fBNIS+\fR table. Programs use the
\fBgetprofattr\fR(3SECDB) routines to gain access to this information.
.sp
.LP
The search order for multiple \fBprof_attr\fR sources is specified in the
\fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR file, as described in the \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4)
man page.
.sp
.LP
An execution profile is a mechanism used to bundle together the commands
and authorizations needed to perform a specific function. An execution
profile can also contain other execution profiles. Each entry in the
\fBprof_attr\fR database consists of one line of text containing five fields
separated by colons
.RB ( : ).
Line continuations using the backslash
(\fB\e\fR) character are permitted. The format of each entry is:
.sp
.LP
\fIprofname\fR:\fIres1\fR:\fIres2\fR:\fIdesc\fR:\fIattr\fR
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIprofname\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The name of the profile. Profile names are case-sensitive.

A long description. This field should explain the purpose of the profile,
including what type of user would be interested in using it. The long
description should be suitable for displaying in the help text of an
application.

.rt
An optional list of semicolon-separated (\fB;\fR) key-value pairs that
describe the security attributes to apply to the object upon execution. Zero
or more keys can be specified. There are four valid keys: \fBhelp\fR,
\fBprofiles\fR,
.BR auths ,
and
.BR privs .
.sp
\fBhelp\fR is assigned the name of a file ending in \fB\&.htm\fR or
\fB\&.html\fR.
.sp
\fBauths\fR specifies a comma-separated list of authorization names chosen
from those names defined in the
.BR auth_attr (4)
database. Authorization
names can be specified using the asterisk (\fB*\fR) character as a wildcard.
For example,
.B solaris.printer.*
would mean all of Sun's authorizations
for printing.
.sp
\fBprofiles\fR specifies a comma-separated list of profile names chosen
from those names defined in the \fBprof_attr\fR database.
.sp
\fBprivs\fR specifies a comma-separated list of privileges names chosen
from those names defined in the
.BR priv_names (4)
database. These
privileges can then be used for executing commands with \fBpfexec\fR(1).
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1\fR Allowing Execution of All Commands
.sp
.LP
The following entry allows the user to execute all commands:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBAll:::Use this profile to give a :help=All.html\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2\fR Consulting the Local \fBprof_attr\fR File First
.sp
.LP
With the following \fBnsswitch.conf\fR entry, the local \fBprof_attr\fR
file is consulted before the
.B NIS+
table:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBprof_attr: files nisplus\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH FILES
.sp
.LP
\fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR
.sp
.LP
\fB/etc/security/prof_attr\fR
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
When deciding which authorization source to use  (see
.BR DESCRIPTION ),
keep in mind that
.B NIS+
provides stronger authentication than
.BR NIS .
.sp
.LP
The root user is usually defined in local databases because root needs to
be able to log in and do system maintenance in single-user mode and at other
times when the network name service databases are not available. So that the
profile definitions for root can be located at such times, root's profiles
should be defined in the local \fBprof_attr\fR file, and the order shown in
the example
.BR nsswitch.conf (4)
file entry under EXAMPLES is highly
recommended.
.sp
.LP
Because the list of legal keys is likely to expand, any code that parses
this database must be written to ignore unknown key-value pairs without
error. When any new keywords are created, the names should be prefixed with
a unique string, such as the company's stock symbol, to avoid potential
naming conflicts.
.sp
.LP
Each application has its own requirements for whether the
.B help
value
must be a relative pathname ending with a filename or the name of a file.
The only known requirement is for the name of a file.
.sp
.LP
The following characters are used in describing the database format and
must be escaped with a backslash if used as data: colon
.RB ( : ),
semicolon
(\fB;\fR), equals
.RB ( = ),
and backslash (\fB\e\fR).
