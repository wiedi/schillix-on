.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "\fBscsi_hba_init()\fR"
.sp
.LP
\fBscsi_hba_init()\fR is the system-provided initialization routine for
\fBSCSI HBA\fR drivers.  The \fBscsi_hba_init()\fR function registers
the
.B HBA
in the system and allows the driver to accept configuration
requests on behalf of
.B SCSI
.RB "target drivers. The" " scsi_hba_init()"
routine must be called in the \fBHBA\fR's \fB_init\fR(9E) routine before
.BR mod_install (9F)
is called. If \fBmod_install\fR(9F) fails, the
\fBHBA\fR's \fB_init\fR(9E) should call \fBscsi_hba_fini()\fR before
returning failure.
.SS "\fBscsi_hba_fini()\fR"
.sp
.LP
\fBscsi_hba_fini()\fR is the system provided completion routine for
\fBSCSI HBA\fR drivers. \fBscsi_hba_fini()\fR removes all of the
system references for the
.B HBA
that were created in
.BR scsi_hba_init() .
The \fBscsi_hba_fini()\fR routine should be called in
the \fBHBA\fR's \fB_fini\fR(9E) routine if
.BR mod_remove (9F)
is
successful.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBscsi_hba_init()\fR returns \fB0\fR if successful, and a non-zero value
otherwise. If
.B scsi_hba_init()
fails, the HBA's
.B _init()
entry
point should return the value returned by
.BR scsi_hba_init() .
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
\fBscsi_hba_init()\fR and \fBscsi_hba_fini()\fR should be called from
.BR _init (9E)
or \fB_fini\fR(9E), respectively.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The
.B HBA
is responsible for ensuring that no
.B DDI
request
routines are called on behalf of its
.B SCSI
target drivers once
\fBscsi_hba_fini()\fR is called.
