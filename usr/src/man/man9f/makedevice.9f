.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmakedevice()\fR function creates a device number from a major and
minor device number. \fBmakedevice()\fR should be used to create device
numbers so the driver will port easily to releases that treat device numbers
differently.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The device number, containing both the major number and the minor number,
is returned. No validation of the major or minor numbers is performed.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBmakedevice()\fR function can be called from user, interrupt, or
kernel context.
