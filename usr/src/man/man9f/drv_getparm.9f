.SH NAME
drv_getparm \- retrieve kernel state information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/ddi.h>



\fBint\fR \fBdrv_getparm\fR(\fBunsigned int\fR \fIparm\fR, \fBvoid *\fIvalue_p\fR);
.fi

.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIparm\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt
The kernel parameter to be obtained. Possible values are:
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBLBOLT\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Read the value of \fBlbolt\fR. \fBlbolt\fR is a \fBclock_t\fR that is
unconditionally incremented by one at each clock tick. No special treatment
is applied when this value overflows the maximum value of the signed
integral type \fBclock_t\fR. When this occurs, its value will be negative,
and its magnitude will be decreasing until it again passes zero. It can
therefore not be relied upon to provide an indication of the amount of time
that passes since the last system reboot, nor should it be used to mark an
absolute time in the system. Only the difference between two measurements of
\fBlbolt\fR is significant. It is used in this way inside the system kernel
for timing purposes.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBPPGRP\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Read the process group identification number. This number determines which
processes should receive a \fBHANGUP\fR or \fBBREAK\fR signal when detected
by a driver.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBUPROCP\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Read the process table token value.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBPPID\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Read process identification number.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBPSID\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Read process session identification number.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBTIME\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Read time in seconds.
.RE

.sp

\fBUCRED\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Return a pointer to the caller's credential structure.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIvalue_p\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
A pointer to the data space in which the value of the parameter is to be
copied.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Since the release of the Solaris 2.6 operating environment, the
\fBdrv_getparm()\fR function has been replaced by \fBddi_get_lbolt\fR(9F),
\fBddi_get_time\fR(9F), and \fBddi_get_pid\fR(9F).
.sp
.LP
The \fBdrv_getparm()\fR function verifies that \fIparm\fR corresponds to a
kernel parameter that may be read. If the value of \fIparm\fR does not
correspond to a parameter or corresponds to a parameter that may not be
read, \fB-1\fR is returned. Otherwise, the value of the parameter is stored
in the data space pointed to by \fIvalue_p\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdrv_getparm()\fR function does not explicitly check to see whether
the device has the appropriate context when the function is called and the
function does not check for correct alignment in the data space pointed to
by \fIvalue_p\fR. It is the responsibility of the driver writer to use this
function only when it is appropriate to do so and to correctly declare the
data space needed by the driver.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBdrv_getparm()\fR function returns \fB0\fR to indicate success,
\fB-1\fR to indicate failure. The value stored in the space pointed to by
\fIvalue_p\fR is the value of the parameter if \fB0\fR is returned, or
undefined if \fB-1\fR is returned. \fB-1\fR is returned if you specify a
value other than \fBLBOLT\fR, \fBPPGRP\fR, \fBPPID\fR, \fBPSID\fR,
\fBTIME\fR, \fBUCRED\fR, or \fBUPROCP\fR. Always check the return code when
using this function.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBdrv_getparm()\fR function can be called from user context only when
using \fBPPGRP\fR, \fBPPID\fR, \fBPSID\fR, \fBUCRED\fR, or \fBUPROCP\fR. It
can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context when using the
\fBLBOLT\fR or \fBTIME\fR argument.
