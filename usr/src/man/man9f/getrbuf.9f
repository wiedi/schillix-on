.SH NAME
getrbuf \- get a raw buffer header
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <sys/ddi.h>



\fBstruct buf *\fBgetrbuf\fR(\fBint\fR \fIsleepflag\fR);

.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIsleepflag\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Indicates whether driver should sleep for free space.
.RE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetrbuf()\fR function allocates the space for a buffer header to the
caller. It is used in cases where a block driver is performing raw
(character interface) I/O and needs to set up a buffer header that is not
associated with the buffer cache.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetrbuf()\fR function calls \fBkmem_alloc\fR(9F) to perform the
memory allocation. \fBkmem_alloc()\fRrequires the information included in
the \fIsleepflag\fR argument. If \fIsleepflag\fR is set to \fBKM_SLEEP\fR,
the driver may sleep until the space is freed up. If \fIsleepflag\fR is set
to
.BR KM_NOSLEEP ,
the driver will not sleep.  In either case, a pointer
to the allocated space is returned or
.B NULL
to indicate that no space
was available.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetrbuf()\fR function returns a pointer to the allocated buffer
header, or
.B NULL
if no space is available.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetrbuf()\fR function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel
context. (Drivers must not allow \fBgetrbuf()\fR to sleep if called from an
interrupt routine.)
