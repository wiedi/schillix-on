.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBscsi_log()\fR function is a utility function that displays a message
via the \fBcmn_err\fR(9F) routine. The error levels that can be passed in to
this function are \fBCE_PANIC\fR, \fBCE_WARN\fR, \fBCE_NOTE\fR,
\fBCE_CONT\fR, and \fBSCSI_DEBUG\fR. The last level is used to assist in
displaying debug messages to the console only. \fIdrv_name\fR is the short
name by which this device is known; example disk driver names are \fBsd\fR
and \fBcmdk\fR. If the \fIdev_info_t\fR pointer is \fINULL\fR, then the
\fIdrv_name\fR will be used with no unit or long name.
.sp
.LP
If the first character in \fIformat\fR is:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
An exclamation mark (\fB!\fR), the message goes only to the system
buffer.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A caret (\fB^\fR), the message goes only to the console.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A question mark (\fB?\fR) and \fIlevel\fR is \fBCE_CONT\fR, the message is
always sent to the system buffer, but is written to the console only when
the system has been booted in verbose mode. See \fBkernel\fR(1M). If neither
condition is met, the \fB?\fR character has no effect and is simply
ignored.
.RE
.sp
.LP
All formatting conversions in use by \fBcmn_err()\fR also work with
\fBscsi_log()\fR.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBscsi_log()\fR function may be called from user, interrupt, or kernel
context.
