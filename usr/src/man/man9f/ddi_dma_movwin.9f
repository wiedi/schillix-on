.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

#include <sys/ddi.h>
#include <sys/sunddi.h>



\fBint\fR \fBddi_dma_movwin\fR(\fBddi_dma_handle_t\fR \fIhandle\fR, \fBoff_t *\fIoffp\fR,
     \fBuint_t *\fIlenp\fR, \fBddi_dma_cookie_t *\fIcookiep\fR);
.fi

.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
This interface is obsolete. \fBddi_dma_getwin\fR(9F) should be used
instead.
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIhandle\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
The \fBDMA\fR handle filled in by a call to \fBddi_dma_setup\fR(9F).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIoffp\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
A pointer to an offset to set the \fBDMA\fR window to. Upon a successful
return, it will be filled in with the new offset from the beginning of the
object resources are allocated for.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIlenp\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
A pointer to a value which must either be the current size of the \fBDMA\fR
window (as known from a call to \fBddi_dma_curwin\fR(9F) or from a previous
call to \fBddi_dma_movwin()\fR). Upon a successful return, it will be filled
in with the size, in bytes, of the current window.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIcookiep\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
A pointer to a \fBDMA\fR cookie (see \fBddi_dma_cookie\fR(9S)). Upon a
successful return, cookiep is filled in just as if an implicit
\fBddi_dma_htoc\fR(9F) had been made.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBddi_dma_movwin()\fR function shifts the current \fBDMA\fR window. If
a \fBDMA\fR request allows the system to allocate resources for less than
the entire object by setting the \fBDDI_DMA_PARTIAL\fR flag in the
\fBddi_dma_req\fR(9S) structure, the current \fBDMA\fR window can be shifted
by a call to \fBddi_dma_movwin()\fR.
.sp
.LP
The caller must first determine the current \fBDMA\fR window size by a call
to \fBddi_dma_curwin\fR(9F). Using the current offset and size of the window
thus retrieved, the caller of \fBddi_dma_movwin()\fR may change the window
onto the object by changing the offset by a value which is some multiple of
the size of the \fBDMA\fR window.
.sp
.LP
The \fBddi_dma_movwin()\fR function takes care of underlying resource
synchronizations required to \fBshift\fR the window. However, if you want to
\fBaccess\fR the data prior to or after moving the window, further
synchronizations using \fBddi_dma_sync\fR(9F) are required.
.sp
.LP
This function is normally called from an interrupt routine. The first
invocation of the \fBDMA\fR engine is done from the driver. All subsequent
invocations of the \fBDMA\fR engine are done from the interrupt routine. The
interrupt routine checks to see if the request has been completed. If it
has, it returns without invoking another \fBDMA\fR transfer. Otherwise it
calls \fBddi_dma_movwin()\fR to shift the current window and starts another
\fBDMA\fR transfer.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBddi_dma_movwin()\fR function returns:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBDDI_SUCCESS\fR

The current length and offset are legal and have been set.

.RS 15n
.rt
Otherwise.
