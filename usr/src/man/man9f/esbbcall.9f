esbbcall \- call function when buffer is available
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <sys/stream.h>



\fBbufcall_id_t\fR \fBesbbcall\fR(\fBuint_t\fR \fIpri\fR, \fBvoid\fR (\fI*func\fR)(\fIvoid *arg\fR),

called by \fBesbbcall()\fR).

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBesbbcall()\fR function, like \fBbufcall\fR(9F), serves as a
\fBtimeout\fR(9F) call of indeterminate length. If \fBesballoc\fR(9F) is
unable to allocate a message and data block header to go with its externally
supplied data buffer, \fBesbbcall()\fR can be used to schedule the routine
\fIfunc\fR, to be called with the argument \fIarg\fR when a buffer becomes
available. The \fIfunc\fR argument can be a routine that calls
\fBesballoc\fR(9F) or it may be another kernel function.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
On success, a \fBbufcall\fR \fBID\fRis returned. On failure, \fB0\fR is
returned. The value returned from a successful call should be saved for
possible future use with \fBunbufcall()\fR should it become necessary to
cancel the \fBesbbcall()\fR request (as at driver close time).
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBesbbcall()\fR function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel
context.
