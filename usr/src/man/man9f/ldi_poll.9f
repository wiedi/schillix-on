.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_poll()\fR function passes a poll request to the device entry
point for the device specified by the layered handle. This operation is
supported for block, character, and streams devices.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_poll()\fR function returns \fB0\fR upon success. If a failure
occurs before the request is passed on to the device, possible return values
are:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEINVAL\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Invalid input parameters.
