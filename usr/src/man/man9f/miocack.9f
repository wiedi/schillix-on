.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmiocack()\fR function converts an M_IOCTL message into a M_IOCACK
message and sends the resulting message upstream.
.sp
.LP
To convert the message, \fBmiocack()\fR changes the message type to
M_IOCACK, sets the 'ioc_count' and 'ioc_rval' members of the
\fBiocblk\fR(9S) associated with \fImp\fR to the passed-in values, and
clears the 'ioc_error' field. If the caller specifies a non-zero value for
count, it is expected that the caller has already set 'mp->b_cont' field to
point to a message block with a length of at least \fIcount\fR bytes.
.sp
.LP
Callers that only need to perform the message conversion, or need to
perform additional steps between the conversion and the      sending of the
M_IOCACK should use \fBmioc2ack\fR(9F).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
None.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
This function can be called from user, kernel or interrupt context.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Callers must not hold any locks across a \fBmiocack()\fR that can be
acquired as part of \fBput\fR(9E) processing.
