.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The following service impact values are accepted by
.BR ddi_fm_service_impact() :
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B DDI_SERVICE_LOST
.ad
.RS 26n
.rt
The service provided by the device is unavailable due to an error. The
operational state of the device will transition to
.BR DEVI_DEVICE_DOWN .
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B DDI_SERVICE_DEGRADED
.ad
.RS 26n
.rt
The driver is unable to provide normal service, but it can provide a
partial or degraded level of service. The driver might have to make repeated
attempts to perform an operation before it succeeds, or it may be running at
less than its configured speed. A driver may use this value to indicate that
an alternative device should be used if available, but that it can continue
operation if no alternative exists. The operational state of the device will
transition to
.BR DEVI_DEVICE_DEGRADED .
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B DDI_SERVICE_RESTORED
.ad
.RS 26n
.rt
The service provided by the device has been restored. The operational state
of the device will transition to its pre-error condition state and
\fBDEVI_DEVICE_DOWN\fR or \fBDEVI_DEVICE_DEGRADED\fR is removed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B DDI_SERVICE_UNAFFECTED
.ad
.RS 26n
.rt
The service provided by the device was unaffected by the error.
