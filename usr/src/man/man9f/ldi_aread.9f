.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_awrite()\fR function passes an asynchronous write request to a
device entry point specified by the layered handle. This operation is
supported for block and character devices.
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_aread()\fR function passes an asynchronous read request to a
device entry point specified by the layered handle. This operation is
supported for block and character devices.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_awrite()\fR and \fBldi_aread()\fR functions return \fB0\fR upon
success. If a failure occurs before the request is passed on to the device,
the possible return values are shown below. Otherwise any other error number
may be returned by the device.
