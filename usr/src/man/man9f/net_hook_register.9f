.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnet_hook_register()\fR function uses hooks that allow callbacks to
be registered with events that belong to a network protocol. A successful
call to \fBnet_hook_register()\fR requires that a valid handle for a network
protocol be provided (the \fInet\fR parameter), along with a hook
description that includes a reference to an available event.
.sp
.LP
While it is possible to use the same \fBhook_t\fR structure with multiple
calls to \fBnet_hook_register()\fR, it is not encouraged.
.sp
.LP
The \fBhook_t\fR structure passed in with this function is described by
\fBhook_t\fR(9S). The following describes how this structure is used.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBh_func\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
Must be non-NULL and represent a function that fits the specified
interface.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBh_name\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
Gives the hook a name that represents its owner. No duplication of
\fBh_name\fR among the hooks present for an event is allowed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBh_flags\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
Currently unused and must be set to 0.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBh_hint, h_hintvalue\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
Specify a hint to \fBnet_hook_register()\fR on how to insert this hook. If
the hint cannot be specified, then an error is returned.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBh_arg;\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
May take any value that the consumer wishes to have passed back when the
hook is activated.
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If the \fBnet_hook_register()\fR function succeeds, 0 is returned.
Otherwise, one of the following errors is returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBENOMEM\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The system cannot allocate any more memory to support registering this
hook.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBENXIO\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
A hook cannot be found among the given family of events.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEEXIST\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
A hook with the given \fBh_name\fR already exists on that event.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBESRCH\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
A before or after dependency cannot be satisfied due to the hook with
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEBUSY\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The \fBh_hint\fR field specifies a hint that cannot currently be satisfied
because it conflicts with another hook. An example of this might be
specifying \fBHH_FIRST\fR or \fBHH_LAST\fR when another hook has already
been registered with this value.

.SH CONTEXT
