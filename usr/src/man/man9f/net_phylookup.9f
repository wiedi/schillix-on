.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B net_phylookup()
function attempts to resolve the interface name
passed in with the network protocol.
.sp
.LP
When called successfully, the value returned represents a network interface
that exists, at the time of the call, within the scope of the network
interface. This value is only guaranteed to be unique for a name within the
scope of the network protocol.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The
.B net_phylookup()
function returns -1 if it is not supported by the
network protocol,  and 0 if the named network interface does not exist (or
is otherwise  unknown).  Otherwise, it returns  a  value  greater than 0
representing a network interface that currently exists within the scope of
this network protocol.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The
.B net_phylookup()
function may be called from user,  kernel, or
interrupt context.
