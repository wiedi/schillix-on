.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBscsi_slave()\fR checks for the presence of a \fBSCSI\fR device. Target
drivers may use this function in their \fBprobe\fR(9E) routines.
\fBscsi_slave()\fR determines if the device is present by using a Test Unit
Ready command followed by an Inquiry command. If \fBscsi_slave()\fR is
successful, it will fill in the \fBscsi_inquiry\fR structure, which is the
\fBsd_inq\fR member of the \fBscsi_device\fR(9S) structure, and return
\fBSCSI_PROBE_EXISTS\fR. This information can be used to determine if the
target driver has probed the correct SCSI device type. \fIcallback\fR
indicates what the allocator routines should do when \fBDMA \fRresources are
not available:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNULL_FUNC\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 16n

Do not wait for resources. Return a \fINULL\fR pointer.

Wait indefinitely for resources.

\fIcallback\fR points to a function which is called when resources may have
become available. \fIcallback\fR \fBmust\fR return either \fB0\fR
(indicating that it attempted to allocate resources but again failed to do
so), in which case it is put back on a list to be called again later, or
\fB1\fR indicating either success in allocating resources or indicating that
it no longer cares for a retry.

.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
\fBscsi_slave()\fR is normally called from the target driver's
\fBprobe\fR(9E) or \fBattach\fR(9E) routine. In any case, this routine
should not be called from interrupt context, because it can sleep waiting
for memory to be allocated.
