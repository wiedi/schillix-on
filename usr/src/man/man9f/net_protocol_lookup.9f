.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B net_protocol_lookup()
function attempts to locate a data
structure that defines what capabilities it is exporting through this
interface. The value returned by this call is guaranteed to be valid until
it is passed into a call to \fBnet_protocol_release\fR(9F), after which it
should no longer be treated as valid.
.sp
.LP
The protocol must be a registered name of a network protocol that has been
registered. The symbols
.B NHF_INET
and
.B NHF_INET6
should be passed
to
.B net_protocol_lookup()
as the protocol name to gain access to either
\fBIPv4\fR or \fBIPv6\fR respectively.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The
.B net_protocol_lookup()
function returns
.B NULL
if it does not
find any knowledge about the network protocol referenced. Otherwise, it
returns a value that can be used with other calls in this framework.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The
.B net_protocol_lookup()
function may be called from user,  kernel,
or interrupt context.
