.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBddi_intr_hilevel()\fR function returns non-zero if the specified
interrupt is a "high level" interrupt.
.sp
.LP
High level interrupts must be handled without using system services that
manipulate thread or process states, because these interrupts are not
blocked by the scheduler.
.sp
.LP
In addition, high level interrupt handlers must take care to do a minimum
of work because they are not preemptable.
.sp
.LP
A typical high level interrupt handler would put data into a circular
buffer and schedule a soft interrupt by calling
\fBddi_trigger_softintr()\fR. The circular buffer could be protected by
using a mutex that was properly initialized for the interrupt handler.
.sp
.LP
The \fBddi_intr_hilevel()\fR function can be used before calling
\fBddi_add_intr()\fR to decide which type of interrupt handler should be
used. Most device drivers are designed with the knowledge that the devices
they support will always generate low level interrupts, however some
devices, for example those using SBus or VME bus level 6 or 7 interrupts
must use this test because on some machines those interrupts are high level
(above the scheduler level) and on other machines they are not.
