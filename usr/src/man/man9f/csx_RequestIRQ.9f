.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The function \fBcsx_RequestIRQ()\fR requests an \fBIRQ\fR resource and
registers the client's \fBIRQ\fR handler with Card Services.
.sp
.LP
If a client requires an \fBIRQ\fR,\fBcsx_RequestIRQ()\fR must be called to
request an \fBIRQ\fR resource as well as to register the client's \fBIRQ\fR
handler with Card Services. The client will not receive callbacks at the
\fBIRQ\fR callback handler until \fBcsx_RequestConfiguration\fR(9F) or
\fBcsx_ModifyConfiguration\fR(9F) has successfully returned when either of
these functions are called with the \fBCONF_ENABLE_IRQ_STEERING\fR bit
set.
.sp
.LP
The function \fBcsx_ReleaseIRQ()\fR releases a previously requested
\fBIRQ\fR resource.
.sp
.LP
The Card Services \fBIRQ\fR resource list is adjusted by
\fBcsx_ReleaseIRQ()\fR. Depending on the adapter hardware, the host bus
\fBIRQ\fR connection might also be disabled. Client \fBIRQ\fR handlers
always run above lock level and so should take care to perform only Solaris
operations that are appropriate for an above-lock-level \fBIRQ\fR handler.
.sp
.LP
\fBcsx_RequestIRQ()\fR fails if it has already been called without a
corresponding \fBcsx_ReleaseIRQ()\fR.
.SH STRUCTURE MEMBERS
.sp
.LP
The structure members of \fBirq_req_t\fR are:

The fields are defined as follows:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBSocket\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
Not used in Solaris, but for portability with other Card Services
implementations, it should be set to the logical socket number.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBAttributes\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
This field is bit-mapped. It specifies details about the type of \fBIRQ\fR
desired by the client. The following bits are defined:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBIRQ_TYPE_EXCLUSIVE\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
\fBIRQ\fR is exclusive to this socket. This bit must be set. It indicates
that the system IRQ is dedicated to this PC Card.
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBirq_handler\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
The client \fBIRQ\fR callback handler entry point is passed in the
\fBirq_handler\fR field.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBirq_handler_arg\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
The client can use the \fBirq_handler_arg\fR field to pass client-specific
data to the client \fBIRQ\fR callback handler.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBiblk_cookie\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fBidev_cookie\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
These fields must be used by the client to set up mutexes that are used in
the client's \fBIRQ\fR callback handler.
.RE

.sp
.LP
For a specific \fBcsx_ReleaseIRQ()\fR call, the values in the
\fBirq_req_t\fR structure must be the same as those returned from the
previous \fBcsx_RequestIRQ()\fR call; otherwise, \fBCS_BAD_ARGS\fR is
returned and no changes are made to Card Services resources or the socket
and adapter hardware.
