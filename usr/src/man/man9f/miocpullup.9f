.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmiocpullup()\fR function prepares the payload of the specified
M_IOCTL message for access by ensuring that it consists of at least
\fIsize\fR bytes of data.
.sp
.LP
If the M_IOCTL message is transparent, or its total payload is less than
\fIsize\fR bytes, an error is returned.  Otherwise, the payload is
concatenated as necessary to provide contiguous access to at least
\fIsize\fR bytes of data. As a special case, if \fIsize\fR is zero,
\fBmiocpullup()\fR returns successfully, even if no payload exists.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Zero is returned on success. Otherwise an errno value is returned
indicating the problem.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
This function can be called from user, kernel or interrupt context.
