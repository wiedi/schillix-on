.SH NAME
ddi_dma_burstsizes \- find out the allowed burst sizes for a DMA mapping
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIhandle\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
A \fBDMA\fR handle that was filled in by a successful call to
\fBddi_dma_setup\fR(9F). 
.RE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBddi_dma_burstsizes()\fR returns the allowed burst sizes for a \fBDMA\fR
mapping. This value is derived from the \fBdlim_burstsizes\fR member of the
\fBddi_dma_lim_sparc\fR(9S) structure, but it shows the allowable burstsizes
\fBafter\fR imposing on it the limitations of other device layers in
addition to device's own limitations.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBddi_dma_burstsizes()\fR returns a binary encoded value of the allowable
\fBDMA\fR burst sizes. See \fBddi_dma_lim_sparc\fR(9S) for a discussion of
\fBDMA\fR burst sizes.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
This function can be called from user or interrupt context.
