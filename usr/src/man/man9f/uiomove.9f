.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBuiomove()\fR function copies \fInbytes\fR of data to or from the
space defined by the \fBuio\fR structure (described in \fBuio\fR(9S)) and
the driver.
.sp
.LP
The \fBuio_segflg\fR member of the \fBuio\fR(9S) structure determines the
type of space to or from which the transfer is being made. If it is set to
\fBUIO_SYSSPACE\fR, the data transfer is between addresses in the kernel. If
it is set to \fBUIO_USERSPACE\fR, the transfer is between a user program and
kernel space.
.sp
.LP
\fIrwflag\fR indicates the direction of the transfer. If \fBUIO_READ\fR is
set, the data will be transferred from \fIaddress\fR to the buffer(s)
described by \fIuio_p\fR. If \fBUIO_WRITE\fR is set, the data will be
transferred from the buffer(s) described by \fIuio_p\fR to \fIaddress\fR.
.sp
.LP
In addition to moving the data, \fBuiomove()\fR adds the number of bytes
moved to the \fBiov_base\fR member of the \fBiovec\fR(9S) structure,
decreases the \fBiov_len\fR member, increases the \fBuio_offset\fR member of
the \fBuio\fR(9S) structure, and decreases the \fBuio_resid\fR member.
.sp
.LP
This function automatically handles page faults. \fInbytes\fR does not have
to be word-aligned.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBuiomove()\fR function returns \fB0\fR upon success or \fBEFAULT\fR
on failure.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
User context only, if \fBuio_segflg\fR is set to \fBUIO_USERSPACE\fR. User,
interrupt, or kernel context, if \fBuio_segflg\fR is set to
\fBUIO_SYSSPACE\fR.
.SH SEE ALSO

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
If \fBuio_segflg\fR is set to \fBUIO_SYSSPACE\fR and \fIaddress\fR is
selected from user space, the system may panic.
