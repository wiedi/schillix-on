.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
The \fBpollwakeup()\fR function wakes a process waiting on the occurrence
of an event. It should be called from a driver for each occurrence of an
event. The \fBpollhead\fR structure will usually be associated with the
driver's private data structure associated with the particular minor device
where the event has occurred. See \fBchpoll\fR(9E) and \fBpoll\fR(2) for
more detail.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBpollwakeup()\fR function can be called from user, interrupt, or
kernel context.
