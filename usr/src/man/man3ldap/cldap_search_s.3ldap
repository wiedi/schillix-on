.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B cldap_search_s()
function performs an LDAP search using the
Connectionless LDAP (CLDAP) protocol.
.sp
.LP
\fBcldap_search_s()\fR has parameters and behavior identical to that of
.BR ldap_search_s (3LDAP),
except for the addition of the
.IR logdn
parameter.
.I logdn
should contain a distinguished name to be used only
for logging purposed by the LDAP server.  It should be in the text format
described by
.IR "RFC 1779, A String Representation of Distinguished Names" .

.SS "Retransmission Algorithm"
.sp
.LP
\fBcldap_search_s()\fR operates using the CLDAP protocol over
.BR udp (7P).
Since UDP is a non-reliable protocol, a retry mechanism is
used to increase reliability. The \fBcldap_setretryinfo\fR(3LDAP) function
can be used to set two retry parameters:
.IR tries ,
a count of the number
of times to send a search request and
.IR timeout ,
an initial timeout that
determines how long to wait for a response before re-trying. \fItimeout\fR
is specified seconds.  These values are stored in the \fBld_cldaptries\fR
and
.B ld_cldaptimeout
members of the
.B ld
LDAP structure, and the
default values set in
.BR ldap_open "(3LDAP) are 4 and 3 respectively. The"
retransmission algorithm used is:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B Step 1
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Set the current timeout to
.B ld_cldaptimeout
seconds, and the current
LDAP server address to the first LDAP server found during the
.BR ldap_open (3LDAP)
call.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B Step 2
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Send the search request to the current LDAP server address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B Step 3
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Set the wait timeout to the current timeout divided by the number of server
addresses found during
.BR ldap_open "(3LDAP) or to one second, whichever is"
larger. Wait at most that long for a response; if a response is received,
STOP. Note that the wait timeout is always rounded down to the next lowest
second.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B Step 4
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each LDAP server address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B Step 5
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Set the current timeout to twice its previous value and repeat Steps 2
through 5 a maximum of
.I tries
times.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
Assume that the default values for
.I tries
and
.I timeout
of 4 tries
and 3 seconds are used. Further, assume that a space-separated list of two
hosts, each with one address, was passed to
.BR cldap_open (3LDAP).
The
pattern of requests sent will be (stopping as soon as a response is
received):
.sp
.in +2
.nf
  Time		Search Request Sent To:
   +0			Host A try 1
   +1  (0+3/2)		Host B try 1
   +2  (1+3/2)		Host A try 2
   +5  (2+6/2)		Host B try 2
   +8  (5+6/2)		Host A try 3
   +14 (8+12/2)	Host B try 3
   +20 (14+12/2)	Host A try 4
   +32 (20+24/2)	Host B try 4
   +44 (20+24/2)	(give up - no response)
.fi
.in -2

.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
\fBcldap_search_s()\fR returns  \fBLDAP_SUCCESS\fR if a search was
successful and the appropriate LDAP error code otherwise.  See
.BR ldap_error (3LDAP)
for more information.
