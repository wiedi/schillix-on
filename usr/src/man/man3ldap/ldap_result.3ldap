.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B ldap_result()
function is used to wait for and return the result of
an operation previously initiated by one of the LDAP asynchronous operation
functions , for example,
.BR ldap_search (3LDAP),
and
.BR ldap_modify (3LDAP).
Those functions all return  \fB\(mi1\fR in case of
error, and an invocation identifier upon successful initiation of the
operation. The invocation identifier is picked by the library and is guaranteed
to be unique across the LDAP session.  It can be used to request the result of
a specific operation from
.B ldap_result()
through the
.IR msgid
parameter.
.sp
.LP
The
.B ldap_result()
function will block or not, depending upon the setting
of the
.I timeout
parameter. If
.I timeout
is not a null pointer, it
specifies a  maximum interval to wait for the selection to complete.  If
.I timeout
is a null pointer, the select blocks indefinitely. To effect a
poll, the
.I timeout
argument should be a non-null pointer, pointing to a
zero-valued
.B timeval
structure.  See \fBselect\fR(3C) for further
details.
.sp
.LP
If the result of a specific operation is required,
.I msgid
should be set
to the invocation identifier returned when the operation was initiated,
otherwise
.B LDAP_RES_ANY
should be supplied.  The
.I all
parameter only
has meaning for search responses and is used to select whether a single entry
of the search response should be returned, or all results of the search should
be returned.
.sp
.LP
A search response is made up of zero or more search entries followed by a
search result.  If
.I all
is set to 0, search entries will be returned one
at a time as they come in, by means of separate calls to
.BR ldap_result() .
If it is set to a non-zero value, the search response will only be returned in
its entirety, that is, after all entries and the final search result have been
received.
.sp
.LP
Upon success, the type of the result received is returned and the \fIresult\fR
parameter will contain the result of the operation.  This result should be
passed to the LDAP parsing functions, (see \fBldap_first_entry\fR(3LDAP)) for
interpretation.
.sp
.LP
The possible result types returned are:

#define LDAP_RES_BIND          0x61L
#define LDAP_RES_SEARCH_ENTRY  0x64L

.sp
.LP
The
.B ldap_msgfree()
function is used to free the memory allocated for a
result by
.B ldap_result()
or
.BR ldap_search_s (3LDAP)
functions.  It
takes a pointer to the result to be freed and returns the type of the message
it freed.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B ldap_result()
function returns \fB\(mi1\fR on error and 0 if the
specified timeout was exceeded.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The
.B ldap_result()
function allocates memory for results that it
receives. The memory can be freed by calling \fBldap_msgfree\fR(3LDAP).
