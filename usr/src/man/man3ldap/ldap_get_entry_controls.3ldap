.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBldap_get_entry_controls()\fR function retrieves the LDAP v3 controls
included in a directory entry in a chain of search results. The LDAP
controls are specified in an array of \fBLDAPControl\fR structures. Each
\fBLDAPControl\fR structure represents an LDAP control. The function takes
\fIentry\fR as a parameter, which points to an \fBLDAPMessage\fR structure
that represents an entry in a chain of search results.
.sp
.LP
The entry notification controls that are used with persistent search
controls are the only controls that are returned with individual entries.
Other controls are returned with results sent from the server. You can call
\fBldap_parse_result()\fR to retrieve those controls.
