.SH NAME
panels \- character based panels package
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB#include <panel.h>\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B panel
library is built using the
.B curses
library, and any
program using
.B panels
routines must call one of the
.BR curses
initialization routines such as
.BR initscr .
A program using these
routines must be compiled with
.B -lpanel
and
.B -lcurses
on the
\fBcc\fR command line.
.sp
.LP
The
.B panels
package gives the applications programmer a way to have
depth relationships between
.B curses
windows; a
.B curses
window is
associated with every panel. The
.B panels
routines allow
.BR curses
windows to overlap without making visible the overlapped portions of
underlying windows. The initial
.B curses
window,
.BR stdscr ,
lies
beneath all panels. The set of currently visible panels is the
.I deck
of
panels.
.sp
.LP
The
.B panels
package allows the applications programmer to create
panels, fetch and set their associated windows, shuffle panels in the deck,
and manipulate panels in other ways.
