.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B touchwin()
and
.B touchline()
routines throw away all
optimization information about which parts of the window have been touched,
by pretending that the entire window has been drawn on. This is sometimes
necessary when using overlapping windows, since a change to one window
affects the other window, but the records of which lines have been changed
in the other window do not reflect the change. The routine
.B touchline()
only pretends that
.I count
lines have been changed, beginning with line
.IR start .
.sp
.LP
The
.B untouchwin()
routine marks all lines in the window as unchanged
since the last call to
.BR wrefresh() .
.sp
.LP
    The \fBwtouchln()\fR routine makes \fIn\fR lines in the window, starting at line
.IR y ,
look as if they have (\fIchanged\fB=1\fR) or have not (\fIchanged\fB=0\fR) been changed since the last call to \fBwrefresh()\fR.
.sp
.LP
The
.B is_linetouched()
and
.B is_wintouched()
routines return
.B TRUE
if the specified line/window was modified since the last call to
.BR wrefresh() ;
otherwise they return
.BR FALSE .
In addition,
.B is_linetouched()
returns
.B ERR
if
.B line
is not valid for the
given window.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
All routines return the integer
.B ERR
upon failure and an integer value
other than
.B ERR
upon successful completion, unless otherwise noted in
the preceding routine descriptions.
