.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B beep()
and \fBflash()\fR routines are used to signal the terminal
user. The routine
.B beep()
sounds the audible alarm on the terminal, if
possible; if that is not possible, it flashes the screen (visible bell), if
that is possible. The routine \fBflash()\fR flashes the screen, and if that
is not possible, sounds the audible signal. If neither signal is possible,
nothing happens. Nearly all terminals have an audible signal (bell or beep),
but only some can flash the screen.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
These routines always return
.BR OK .
