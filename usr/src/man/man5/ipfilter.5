.SH NAME
ipfilter \- IP packet filtering software
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
IP Filter is software that provides packet filtering capabilities on a
Solaris system. On a properly setup system, it can be used to build a
firewall.
.sp
.LP
Solaris IP Filter is installed with the Solaris operating system. However,
packet filtering is not enabled by default. See \fBipf\fR(1M) for a
procedure to enable and activate the IP Filter feature.
.SH HOST-BASED FIREWALL
.sp
.LP
To simplify IP Filter configuration management, a firewall framework is
created to allow users to configure IP Filter by expressing firewall policy
at system and service level. Given the user-defined firewall policy, the
framework generates a set of IP Filter rules to enforce the desired system
behavior. Users specify system and service firewall policies that allow or
deny network traffic from certain hosts, subnets, and interface(s). The
policies are translated into a set of active IPF rules to enforce the
specified firewall policies.
.LP
Note -

.RS 2
Users can still specify their own ipf rule file if they choose not to take
advantage of the framework. See \fBipf\fR(1M) and \fBipf\fR(4).

A firewall policy includes a firewall mode and an optional set of network
sources. Network sources are IP addresses, subnets, and local network
interfaces, from all of which a system can receive incoming traffic. The
basic set of firewall modes are:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B None
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
No firewall, allow all incoming traffic.

.SS "Layers in Detail"
.sp
.LP
The first system-wide layer, Global Default, defines a firewall policy that
applies to
.B any
incoming traffic, for example, allowing or blocking all
traffic from an IP address. This makes it simple to have a policy that
blocks all incoming traffic or all incoming traffic from unwanted
source(s).
.sp
.LP
The Network Services layer contains firewall policies for local programs
that provide service to remote clients, for example,
.BR telnetd ,
.BR sshd ,
and
.BR httpd .
Each of these programs, a network service, has
its own firewall policy that controls access to its service. Initially, a
service's policy is set to inherit Global Default policy, a "Use Global
Default" mode. This makes it simple to set a single policy, at the Global
Default layer, that can be inherited by all services.
.sp
.LP
When a service's policy is different from Global Default policy, the
service's policy has higher precedence. If Global Default policy is set to
block all traffic from a subnet, the SSH service could be configured to
allow access from certain hosts in that subnet. The set of all policies for
all network services comprises the Network Service layer.
.sp
.LP
The second system-wide layer, Global Override, has a firewall policy that
also applies to any incoming network traffic. This policy has highest
precedence and overrides policies in the other layers, specifically
overriding the needs of network services. The example is when it is
desirable to block known malicious source(s) regardless of services'
policies.
.SS "User Interaction"
.sp
.LP
This framework leverages IP Filter functionality and is active only when
.B svc:/network/ipfilter
is enabled and inactive when
.B network/ipfilter
is disabled. Similarly, a network service's firewall
policy is only active when that service is enabled and inactive when the
service is disabled. A system with an active firewall has IP Filter rules
for each running/enabled network service and system-wide policy(s) whose
firewall mode is not
.BR None .
.sp
.LP
A user configures a firewall by setting the system-wide policies and policy
for each network service. See svc.ipfd(1M) on how to configure a firewall
policy.
.sp
.LP
The firewall framework composes of policy configuration and a mechanism to
generate IP Filter rules from the policy and applying those rules to get the
desired IP Filter configuration. A quick summary of the design and user
