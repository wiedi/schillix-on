.SH NAME
dhcp \- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (\fBDHCP\fR) enables host systems in a \fBTCP/IP\fR network to be configured automatically for the network as they boot. \fBDHCP\fR uses a client/server mechanism: servers store configuration information for clients, and provide that information upon a client's request. The information can include the client's \fBIP\fR address and information about network services available to the client. 
.sp
.LP
This manual page provides a brief summary of the Solaris \fBDHCP\fR implementation.
.SS "Solaris DHCP Client"
.sp
.LP
The Solaris DHCP client is implemented as background daemon, \fBdhcpagent\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
For IPv4, this daemon is started automatically during bootup if there exists at least one \fBdhcp.\fR\fIinterface\fR file in \fB/etc\fR. Only interfaces with a corresponding \fB\fR\fB/etc/dhcp.\fR\fB\fIinterface\fR\fR file are automatically configured during boot. 
.sp
.LP
For IPv6, this daemon is started automatically when commanded by \fBin.ndpd\fR (based on IPv6 Routing Advertisement messages). No \fB/etc/dhcp\fR.\fIinterface\fR file is necessary, but such a file can be used to specify an interface as "primary," provided that IPv4 DHCP is also in use.
.sp
.LP
Network parameters needed for system configuration during bootup are extracted from the information received by the daemon through the use of the \fBdhcpinfo\fR(1) command. The daemon's default behavior can be altered by changing the tunables in the \fB/etc/default/dhcpagent\fR file. The daemon is controlled by the \fBifconfig\fR(1M) utility. Check the status of the daemon using the \fBnetstat\fR(1M) and \fBifconfig\fR(1M) commands. 
.SS "Solaris DHCP Server"
.sp
.LP
The Solaris \fBDHCP\fR server is implemented as a background daemon, \fBin.dhcpd\fR(1M). This daemon can deliver network configuration information to either \fBBOOTP\fR or \fBDHCP\fR clients. The Solaris \fBDHCP\fR service can be managed using the \fBdhcpmgr\fR(1M) \fBGUI\fR or the command line utilities \fBdhcpconfig\fR(1M), \fBdhtadm\fR(1M), and \fBpntadm\fR(1M).
.SS "DHCP Configuration Tables"
.sp
.LP
The Solaris \fBDHCP\fR server stores client configuration information in the following two types of tables: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBdhcptab\fR tables\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Contain macros and options (also known as symbols), used to construct a package of configuration information to send to each \fBDHCP\fR client. There exists only one \fBdhcptab\fR for the \fBDHCP\fR service. The \fBdhcptab\fR(4) can be viewed and modified using the \fBdhtadm\fR(1M) command or \fBdhcpmgr\fR(1M) graphical utility. See \fBdhcptab\fR(4) for more information about the syntax of \fBdhcptab\fR records. See \fBdhcp_inittab\fR(4) for more information about the \fBDHCP\fR options and symbols.

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBDHCP\fR network tables\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
\fBDHCP\fR network tables, which contain mappings of client \fBID\fRs to \fBIP\fR addresses and parameters associated with those addresses. Network tables are named with the \fBIP\fR address of the network, and can be created, viewed, and modified using the \fBpntadm\fR command or \fBdhcpmgr\fR graphical utility. See \fBdhcp_network\fR(4) for more information about network tables.
