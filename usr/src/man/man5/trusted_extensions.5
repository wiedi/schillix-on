.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
Solaris\u\s-2TM\s+2\d Trusted Extensions software is a specific configuration of the Solaris Operating System (Solaris OS). Solaris Trusted Extensions (Trusted Extensions) provides labels for local objects and processes, for the desktop and windowing system, for zones and file systems, and for network communications. These labels are used to implement a Multilevel Security (MLS) policy that restricts the flow of information based on label relationships. In contrast to Discretionary Access Control (DAC) based on ownership, the MLS policy enforced by Trusted Extensions is an example of Mandatory Access Control (MAC).
