.SH NAME
ipkg \- ipkg branded zone
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B ipkg
brand uses the branded zones framework described in
.BR brands (5)
to run zones installed with the same software as is
installed in the global zone. The system software must always be in sync
with the global zone when using a
.B ipkg
brand. The system software
packages within the zone are managed using the image packaging system. See
.BR pkg(5) .
.SS "Configuration and Administration"
.sp
.LP
The
.B ipkg
brand supports the whole root non-global zone model. All of
the required system software and any additional packages are installed into
the private file systems of the zone. The zone must reside on its own
\fBzfs\fR(1M) dataset and only ZFS is supported. The ZFS dataset is created
automatically when the zone is installed or attached. If a ZFS dataset
cannot be created, the zone is not installed or attached.
.SH SUB-COMMANDS
.sp
.LP
The following
.B ipkg
brand-specific subcommand options are supported by
.BR zoneadm (1M).

\fBattach\fR [\fB-a\fR \fIarchive\fR | \fB-d\fR \fIpath\fR]

.RS 4n
Attach the specified
.B ipkg
branded zone image into the zone. If
neither
.B -a
or
.B -d
is specified, the zone's zonepath is assumed to
already be properly installed with the zone's files.
.B zoneadm
checks
package levels on the machine to which the zone is to be attached. If the
packages that the zone depends on from the global zone are different (have
different revision numbers) from the dependent packages on the source
machine,
.B zoneadm
reports these conflicts and does not perform the
attach. If the destination system has only newer dependent packages (higher
revision numbers) than those on the source system, you can use the
\fB-u\fRoption to update the attached zone to match the revision of the
packages that exist on the new system. With
.BR -u ,
as in the default
behavior,
.B zoneadm
does not perform an attach if outdated packages are
found on the target system.

.RS 4n
The
.B ipkg
brand installer supports installing the zone from either the
software repository or from an image of an installed system running the same
release. This can be a
.BR cpio (1)
or
.BR pax (1)
\fBxustar\fR archive.
The
.B cpio
archive can be compressed with
.B gzip
or
.BR bzip2 .
The
image can also be a path to the top-level of a system's root tree, or a
pre-existing zone path.
.sp
If neither the
.B -a
or
.B -d
option is used, the zone is installed
from the repository.
.sp
To install the zone from a system image either the
.B -a
or
.B -d
is
required. Either the
.B -u
or
.B -p
option is also required in this
case.
