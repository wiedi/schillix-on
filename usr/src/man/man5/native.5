.SH NAME
native \- native branded zone
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The native brand uses the branded zones framework described in
\fBbrands\fR(5) to run zones installed with the same software as is
installed in the global zone. The system software must always be in sync
with the global zone when using a native brand.
.SH SUB-COMMANDS
.sp
.LP
The following native brand-specific subcommand options are supported in
\fBzoneadm\fR(1M).

\fB\fBattach\fR [\fB-u\fR] [\fB-b\fR \fIpatchid\fR]...\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
For native zones, \fBzoneadm\fR checks package and patch levels on the
machine to which the zone is to be attached. If the packages/patches that
the zone depends on from the global zone are different (have different
revision numbers) from the dependent packages/patches on the source machine,
\fBzoneadm\fR reports these conflicts and does not perform the attach. If
the destination system has only newer dependent packages/patches (higher
revision numbers) than those on the source system, you can use the \fB-u\fR
option to update the attached zone to match the \fB-revision\fR packages and
patches that exist on the new system. With \fB-u\fR, as in the default
behavior, \fBzoneadm\fR does not perform an attach if outdated
packages/patches are found on the target system.
.sp
For native zones, one or more \fB-b\fR options can be used to specify a
patch ID for a patch installed in the zone. These patches will be backed out
before the zone is attached or, if \fB-u\fR was also specified, updated.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
The native brand installer supports installing the zone from either the
software already installed on the system or from an image of an installed
system running the same release.  This can be a full flash archive (see
\fBflash_archive\fR(4)) or a \fBcpio\fR(1) or \fBpax\fR(1) "xustar" archive.
The \fBcpio\fR archive be compressed with \fBgzip\fR or \fBbzip2\fR.  The
image can also be a level \fB0\fR \fBufsdump\fR(1M), a path to the top-level
of a system's root tree, or a pre-existing zone path.
.sp
With no options the zone is installed using same software as is running the
global zone.
.sp
To install the zone from a system image either the \fB-a\fR or \fB-d\fR is
required. Either the \fB-u\fR or \fB-p\fR option is also required in this
case.

system. \fBcpio\fR archives may be compressed using \fBgzip\fR or
\fBbzip2\fR.
