mms \- MMS service overview
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
MMS is a distributed removable media management system. It is based on the
standard, \fIIEEE 1244, Media Management System (MMS)\fR.
.sp
.LP
The current implementation of MMS manages tapes and cartridges in a Sun
StorageTek ACSLS tape library and emulated tapes on a file system. MMS is
capable of sharing drives among multiple hosts. An important feature of MMS
is that it provides a uniform and consistent tape interface to its client
applications.
.sp
.LP
MMS consists of a media manager (MM) which manages the entire MMS system.
Information about the system is maintained by MM in a database.
.sp
.LP
Every library managed by MMS has an active library manager (LM). An LM
provides library access and mounting service to MMS.
.sp
.LP
A drive managed by MMS has a drive manager (DM) on each host that has
access to the drive. A DM provides device specific operations. A DM also
provides label processing. The current implementation supports only ANSI
labels.
.sp
.LP
MMS client applications request MM to mount and unmount cartridges and
process them after they are mounted. Applications use the Media Management
Protocol (MMP) to make requests. A library of client application functions
is available.
.sp
.LP
The Solaris implementation of the MMS uses the \fBmmsinit\fR(1M) command to
configure and start the MMS service and the \fBmmsadm\fR(1M) command to list
and set parameters required by the service.
