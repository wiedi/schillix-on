.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The file system tree is organized for administrative convenience. Distinct
areas within the file system tree are provided for files that are private to
one machine, files that can be shared by multiple machines of a common
platform, files that can be shared by all machines, and home directories.
This organization allows sharable files to be stored on one machine but
accessed by many machines using a remote file access mechanism such as
\fBNFS\fR. Grouping together similar files makes the file system tree easier
to upgrade and manage.
.sp
.LP
The file system tree consists of a root file system and a collection of
mountable file systems. The \fBmount\fR(2) program attaches mountable file
systems to the file system tree at mount points (directory entries) in the
root file system or other previously mounted file systems. Two file systems,
\fB/\fR (the root) and \fB/usr\fR, must be mounted and \fB/var\fR must be
accessible to have a functional system. The root file system is mounted
automatically by the kernel at boot time; the \fB/usr\fR file system is
mounted by the system start-up script, which is run as part of the booting
process. \fB/var\fR can be mounted as its own file system or be part of
\fB/usr\fR, as it is by default.
.sp
.LP
Certain locations, noted below, are approved installation locations for
bundled Foundation Solaris software. In some cases, the approved locations
for bundled software are also approved locations for add-on system software
or for applications. The following descriptions make clear where the two
locations differ. For example, \fB/etc\fR is the installation location for
platform-dependent configuration files that are bundled with Solaris
software. The analogous location for applications is
\fB/etc/opt/\fIpackagename\fR.
.sp
.LP
In the following descriptions, \fIsubsystem\fR is a category of application
or system software, such as a window system (\fBdt\fR) or a language
(\fBjava1.2\fR)
.sp
.LP
The following descriptions make use of the terms \fBplatform\fR,
\fBplatform-dependent\fR, \fBplatform-independent\fR, and
\fBplatform-specific\fR. Platform refers to a machines Instruction Set
Architecture or processor type, such as is returned by \fBuname\fR \fB-i\fR.
\fBPlatform-dependent\fR refers to a file that is installed on all platforms
and whose contents vary depending on the platform. Like a platform-dependent
file, a \fBplatform-independent\fR file is installed on all platforms.
However, the contents of the latter type remains the same on all platforms.
An example of a platform-dependent file is compiled, executable program. An
example of a platform-independent file is a standard configuration file,
such as \fB/etc/hosts\fR. Unlike a platform-dependent or a
platform-independent file, the \fBplatform-specific\fR file is installed
only on a subset of supported platforms. Most platform-specific files are
gathered under \fB/platform\fR and \fB/usr/platform\fR.
.sp
.LP
In the following file or directory descriptions, GNOME stands for GNU
Network Object Model Environment. The GNOME Desktop is shipped with the
Solaris operating system.

.SS "\fB/usr\fR File System"

Because it is desirable to keep the root file system small and not
volatile, on disk-based systems larger file systems are often mounted on
\fB/home\fR, \fB/opt\fR, \fB/usr\fR, and \fB/var\fR.
.sp
.LP
The file system mounted on \fB/usr\fR contains platform-dependent and
platform-independent sharable files. The subtree rooted at \fB/usr/share\fR
contains platform-independent sharable files; the rest of the \fB/usr\fR
tree contains platform-dependent files. By mounting a common remote file
system, a group of machines with a common platform may share a single
\fB/usr\fR file system. A single \fB/usr/share\fR file system can be shared
by machines of any platform. A machine acting as a file server can share
many different \fB/usr\fR file systems to support several different
architectures and operating system releases. Clients usually mount
\fB/usr\fR read-only so that they do not accidentally change any shared
files.
