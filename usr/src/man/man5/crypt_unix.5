.SH NAME
crypt_unix \- traditional UNIX crypt algorithm
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B crypt_unix
algorithm is the traditional UNIX crypt algorithm. It is
not considered sufficiently secure for current systems and is provided for
backwards compatibility. The
.BR crypt_sunmd5 (5),
.BR crypt_bsdmd5 (5),
or
\fBcrypt_bsdbf\fR(5) algorithm should be used instead.
.sp
.LP
The algorithm identifier for
.BR policy.conf (4)
is
.BR __unix__ .
There is
no entry in
.BR crypt.conf (4)
for this algorithm.
.sp
.LP
The
.B crypt_unix
algorithm is internal to
.B libc
and provides the
string encoding function used by \fBcrypt\fR(3C) when the first character of
the salt is not a "$".
.sp
.LP
This algorithm is based on a one-way encryption algorithm with variations
intended (among other things) to frustrate use of hardware implementations of
a key search.  Only the first eight characters of the key passed to
\fBcrypt()\fR are used with this algorithm; the rest are silently ignored. The
salt is a two-character string chosen from the set [a-zA-Z0-9./].  This string
is used to perturb the hashing algorithm in one of 4096 different ways.
.sp
.LP
The maximum password length for
.B crypt_unix
is 8 characters.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The return value of the
.B crypt_unix
algorithm might not be portable
among standard-conforming systems. See \fBstandards\fR(5).
