.TH audit_binfile 5 "24 Jun 2009" "SunOS 5.11" "Standards, Environments, and Macros"
.SH NAME
audit_binfile \- generation of Solaris audit logs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/security/audit_binfile.so\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBaudit_binfile\fR plugin module for Solaris audit,
\fB/usr/lib/security/audit_binfile.so\fR, writes binary audit data to files
as configured in
.BR audit_control (4);
it is the default plugin for the
Solaris audit daemon
.BR auditd "(1M). Its output is described by"
.BR audit.log (4).
.sp
.LP
The \fBaudit_binfile\fR plugin is loaded by \fBauditd\fR if
\fBaudit_control\fR contains one or more lines defining audit directories by
means of the
.B dir:
specification or if
.B audit_control
has a
\fBplugin:\fR specification of \fBname=audit_binfile.so\fR.
.SH OBJECT ATTRIBUTES
.sp
.LP
The
.B p_dir
and \fBp_minfree\fR attributes are equivalent to the
\fBdir:\fR and \fBminfree:\fR lines described in
.BR audit_control .
If
both the
.B dir:
line and the
.B p_dir
attribute are used, the plugin
combines all directories into a single list with those specified by means of
\fBdir:\fR at the front of the list. If both the \fBminfree\fR and the
\fBp_minfree\fR attributes are given, the \fBp_minfree\fR value is used.
.sp
.LP
The \fBp_fsize\fR attribute defines the maximum size in bytes that an audit
file can become before it is automatically closed and a new audit file
.RB "opened. This is equivalent to an administrator issuing an" " audit"
\fB-n\fR command when the audit file contains the specified number of bytes.
The default size is zero (0), which allows the file to grow without bound.
The value specified must be within the range of [512,000, 2,147,483,647].
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
The following directives cause \fBaudit_binfile.so\fR to be loaded, specify
the directories for writing audit logs, and specify the percentage of
required free space per directory.
