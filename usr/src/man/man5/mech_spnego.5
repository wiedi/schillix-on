.SH NAME
mech_spnego \- Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
/usr/lib/gss/mech_spnego.so.1
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The SPNEGO security mechanism for \fBGSS\fR-\fBAPI\fR allows
\fBGSS\fR-\fBAPI\fR applications to negotiate the actual security mechanism
to be used in the \fBGSS\fR-\fBAPI\fR session. \fBmech_spnego.so.1\fR is a
shared object module that is dynamically opened by applications that specify
the SPNEGO Object Identifier (\fBOID\fR) in calls to the \fBGSS\fR-\fBAPI\fR
functions (see
.BR libgss (3LIB)).
.sp
.LP
SPNEGO is described by IETF RFC 2478 and is intended to be used in
environments where multiple \fBGSS\fR-\fBAPI\fR mechanisms are available to
the client or server and neither side knows what mechanisms are supported by
the other.
.sp
.LP
When SPNEGO is used, it selects the list of mechanisms to advertise by
reading the
.B GSS
mechanism configuration file,
.B /etc/gss/mech
(see
.BR mech (4)),
and by listing all active mechanisms except for itself.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
SPNEGO may be configured to function in two ways. The first way is to
interoperate with Microsoft SSPI clients and servers that use the Microsoft
"\fBNegotiate\fR" method, which is also based on SPNEGO. The Microsoft
"\fBNegotiate\fR" mechanism does not strictly follow the IETF RFC.
Therefore, use special handling in order to enable full interoperability. In
order to interoperate, place option "\fB[ msinterop ]\fR" at the end of the
SPNEGO line in
.BR /etc/gss/mech .
.sp
.LP
This is an example (from
.BR /etc/gss/mech ):
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBspnego	1.3.6.1.5.5.2	mech_spnego.so	[ msinterop ]\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Without the "\fB[ msinterop ]\fR" option, \fBmech_spnego\fR will follow the
strict IETF RFC 2478 specification and will not be able to negotiate with
Microsoft applications that try to use the SSPI "\fBNegotiate\fR"
mechanism.
.SH INTERFACES
.sp
.LP
\fBmech_spnego.so.1\fR has no public interfaces. It is only activated and
used through the \fBGSS\fR-\fBAPI\fR interface provided by \fBlibgss.so.1\fR
(see
.BR libgss (3LIB)).
