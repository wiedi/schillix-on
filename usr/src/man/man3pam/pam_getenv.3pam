.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_getenv()\fR function searches the \fBPAM\fR handle \fIpamh\fR
for a value associated with \fIname\fR. If a value is present,
\fBpam_getenv()\fR makes a copy of the value and returns a pointer to the
copy back to the calling application. If no such entry exists,
\fBpam_getenv()\fR returns  \fINULL\fR. It is the responsibility of the
calling application to free the memory returned by \fBpam_getenv()\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, \fBpam_getenv()\fR returns a copy of the \fIvalue\fR
associated with \fIname\fR in the \fBPAM\fR handle; otherwise, it returns a
\fINULL\fR pointer.

multithreaded application uses its own \fBPAM\fR handle.
