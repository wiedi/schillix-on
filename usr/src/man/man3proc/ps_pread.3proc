.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These routines copy data between the target process's address space and the
controlling process.
.B ps_pread()
copies
.I size
bytes from address
\fIaddr\fR in the target process into \fIbuf\fR in the controlling process.
\fBpr_pwrite()\fR is like \fBps_pread()\fR except that the direction of the
copy is reversed; data is copied from the controlling process to the target
process.
.sp
.LP
\fBps_pdread()\fR and \fBps_ptread()\fR behave identically to
.BR ps_pread() .
\fBps_pdwrite()\fR and \fBps_ptwrite()\fR behave
identically to
.BR ps_pwrite() .
These functions can be implemented as
simple aliases for the corresponding primary functions. They are artifacts
of history that must be maintained.
.SH RETURN VALUES

space.
