#include <proc_service.h>

\fBps_err_e\fR \fBps_pglobal_lookup\fR(\fBstruct ps_prochandle *\fIph\fR,
     \fBconst char *\fIobject_name\fR, \fBconst char *\fIsym_name\fR,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBps_pglobal_lookup()\fR looks up the symbol \fIsym_name\fR in the symbol
table of the load object \fIobject_name\fR in the target process identified
by \fIph\fR. It returns the symbol's value as an address in the target
process in \fB*\fIsym_addr.\fR
.sp
.LP
\fBps_pglobal_sym()\fR looks up the symbol \fIsym_name\fR in the symbol
table of the load object \fIobject_name\fR in the target process identified
by \fIph\fR. It returns the symbol table entry in \fB*\fIsym.\fR The
value in the symbol table entry is the symbol's value as an address in the
target process.
