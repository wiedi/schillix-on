.SH NAME
dev \- Device name file system
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B dev
filesystem manages the name spaces of devices under the
Solaris operating environment. The global zone's instance of the \fBdev\fR
filesystem is mounted during boot on
.BR /dev .
.sp
.LP
A subdirectory under
.B /dev
may have unique operational semantics. Most
of the common device names under
.B /dev
are created automatically by
\fBdevfsadm\fR(1M). Others, such as
.BR /dev/pts ,
are dynamic and reflect
the operational state of the system. You can manually generate device names
for newly attached hardware by invoking \fBdevfsadm\fR(1M) or implicitly, by
indirectly causing a lookup or readdir operation in the filesystem to occur.
For example, you can discover a disk that was attached when the system was
powered down (and generate a name for that device) by invoking
\fBformat\fR(1M)).
