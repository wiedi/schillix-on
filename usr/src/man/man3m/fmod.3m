.TH fmod 3M "12 Jul 2006" "SunOS 5.11" "Mathematical Library Functions"
.SH NAME
fmod, fmodf, fmodl \- floating-point remainder value function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
c99 [ \fIflag\fR.\|.\|. ] \fIfile\fR.\|.\|. \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR.\|.\|. ]
#include <math.h>

\fBdouble\fR \fBfmod\fR(\fBdouble\fR \fIx\fR, \fBdouble\fR \fIy\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBfloat\fR \fBfmodf\fR(\fBfloat\fR \fIx\fR, \fBfloat\fR \fIy\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBlong double\fR \fBfmodl\fR(\fBlong double\fR \fIx\fR, \fBlong double\fR \fIy\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions return the floating-point remainder of the division of
\fIx\fR by
.IR y .
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
These functions return the value
.I x
\(mi \fIi\fR *
.IR y ,
for some
integer
.I i
such that, if
.I y
is non-zero, the result has the same
sign as
.I x
and magnitude less than the magnitude of
.IR y .
.sp
.LP
If
.I x
or
.I y
is NaN, a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If
.I y
is 0, a domain error occurs and a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If
.I x
is infinite, a domain error occurs and a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If
.I x
is \(+-0 and \fIy\fR is not 0, \(+-0 is returned.
.sp
.LP
If
.I x
is not infinite and
.I y
is \(+-Inf,
.I x
is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
These functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B Domain Error
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The
.I x
argument is infinite or
.I y
is 0.
.sp
If the integer expression (\fBmath_errhandling\fR &
.BR MATH_ERREXCEPT )
is non-zero, the invalid floating-point exception is raised.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
An application wanting to check for exceptions should call
\fBfeclearexcept\fR(\fBFE_ALL_EXCEPT\fR) before calling these functions. On
return, if \fBfetestexcept\fR(\fBFE_INVALID\fR |
.B FE_DIVBYZERO
|
\fBFE_OVERFLOW\fR |
.BR FE_UNDERFLOW )
is non-zero, an exception has been
raised. An application should either examine the return value or check the
floating point exception flags to detect exceptions.
