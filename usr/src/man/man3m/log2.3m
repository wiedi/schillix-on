.TH log2 3M "12 Jul 2006" "SunOS 5.11" "Mathematical Library Functions"
.SH NAME
log2, log2f, log2l \- compute base 2 logarithm functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
c99 [ \fIflag\fR.\|.\|. ] \fIfile\fR.\|.\|. \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR.\|.\|. ]
#include <math.h>

\fBdouble\fR \fBlog2\fR(\fBdouble\fR \fIx\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBfloat\fR \fBlog2f\fR(\fBfloat\fR \fIx\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBlong double\fR \fBlog2l\fR(\fBlong double\fR \fIx\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions compute the base 2 logarithm of their argument
.IR x ,
\fBlog2\fR(\fIx\fR).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return the base 2 logarithm of
.IR x .
.sp
.LP
If
.I x
is \(+-0, a pole error occurs and
.BR log2() ,
\fBlog2f()\fR,
and
.B log2l()
return \(mi\fBHUGE_VAL\fR, \(mi\fBHUGE_VALF\fR, and
\(mi\fBHUGE_VALL\fR, respectively.
.sp
.LP
For finite values of
.I x
that are less than 0,  or if
.I x
is
\(miInf a domain error occurs and a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If
.I x
is NaN, a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If
.I x
is 1, +0 is returned.
.sp
.LP
If
.I x
is +Inf,
.I x
is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
These functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B Domain Error
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The finite value of
.I x
is less than 0, or
.I x
is \(miInf.
.sp
If the integer expression (\fBmath_errhandling\fR & \fBMATH_ERREXCEPT\fR)
is non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception is raised.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B Pole Error
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The value of
.I x
is 0.
.sp
If the integer expression (\fBmath_errhandling\fR & \fBMATH_ERREXCEPT\fR)
is non-zero, then the divide-by-zero floating-point exception is raised.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
An application wanting to check for exceptions should call
\fBfeclearexcept\fR(\fBFE_ALL_EXCEPT\fR) before calling these functions. On
return, if \fBfetestexcept\fR(\fBFE_INVALID\fR |
.B FE_DIVBYZERO
|
\fBFE_OVERFLOW\fR |
.BR FE_UNDERFLOW )
is non-zero, an exception has been
raised. An application should either examine the return value or check the
floating point exception flags to detect exceptions.
