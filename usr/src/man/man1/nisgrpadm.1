.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnisgrpadm\fR utility is used to administer  \fBNIS+\fR groups. This
command administers both groups and the groups' membership lists.
\fBnisgrpadm\fR can create, destroy, or list  \fBNIS+\fR groups.
\fBnisgrpadm\fR can be used to administer a group's membership list. It can
add or delete principals to the group, or test principals for membership in
the group.
.sp
.LP
The names of \fBNIS+\fR groups are syntactically similar to names of
\fBNIS+\fR objects but they occupy a separate namespace. A group named
\fBa.b.c.d.\fR is represented by a \fBNIS+\fR group object named
\fBa.groups_dir.b.c.d.\fR; the functions described here all expect the name
of the group, not the name of the corresponding group object.
.sp
.LP
There are three types of group members:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
An \fIexplicit\fR member is just a \fBNIS+\fR principal-name. For example:
\fBwickedwitch.west.oz.\fR
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
An \fIimplicit\fR ("domain") member, written \fB*.west.oz.\fR, means that
all principals in the given domain belong to this member. No other forms of
wildcarding are allowed; \fBwickedwitch.*.oz.\fR is invalid, as is
\fBwickedwitch.west.*.\fR\|. Note that principals in subdomains of the given
domain are \fInot\fR included.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A \fIrecursive\fR ("group") member, written \fB@cowards.oz.\fR, refers to
another group;  all principals that belong to that group are considered to
belong here.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Any member may be made \fInegative\fR by prefixing it with a minus sign
('\(mi'). A group may thus contain explicit, implicit, recursive, negative
explicit, negative implicit, and negative recursive members.
.sp
.LP
A principal is considered to belong to a group if it belongs to at least
one non-negative group member of the group and belongs to no negative group
members.
.sp
.LP
Principal names  \fImust\fR be fully qualified, whereas groups can be
abbreviated on all operations  \fIexcept\fR create.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-a\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Adds the list of \fBNIS+\fR principals specified to  \fIgroup\fR. The
principal name should be fully qualified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-c\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Creates  \fIgroup\fR in the \fBNIS+\fR namespace. The \fBNIS+\fR group name
should be fully qualified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-d\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Destroys (removes)  \fIgroup\fR from the namespace.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-D\fI defaults\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
When creating objects, this option specifies a different set of  defaults
to be used during this operation. The \fIdefaults\fR string is a series of
tokens separated by colons. These tokens represent the default values to be
used for the generic object properties. All of the legal tokens are
described below.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBttl=\fItime\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
This token sets the default time to live for objects that are created by
this command. The value \fItime\fR is specified in the format as defined by
the \fBnischttl\fR(1) command. The default value is 12 hours.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBowner=\fIownername\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
This token specifies that the \fBNIS+\fR principal \fIownername\fR should
own the created object. Normally this value is the same as the principal who
is executing the command.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBgroup=\fIgroupname\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
This token specifies that the group \fIgroupname\fR should be the group
owner for the object that is created.  The default value is \fINULL.\fR
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBaccess=\fIrights\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
This token specifies the set of access rights that are to be granted for
the given object. The value \fIrights\fR is specified in the format as
defined by the  \fBnischmod\fR(1) command. The default value is
\fB\(mi\|\(mi\|\(mi\|\(mirmcdr\(mi\|\(mi\|\(mir\(mi\|\(mi\|\(mi\fR\&.
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-l\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Lists the membership list of the specified  \fIgroup\fR. (See  \fB-M\fR
option.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-M\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Master server only. Sends the lookup to the master server of the named
data. This guarantees that the most up to date information is seen at the
possible expense that the master server may be busy. Note that the  \fB-M\fR
flag is applicable only with the \fB-l\fR flag.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-r\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Removes the list of principals specified from  \fIgroup\fR. The principal
name should be fully qualified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-s\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Work silently. Results are returned using the exit status of the command.
This status can be translated into a text string using the
\fBniserror\fR(1) command.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-t\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Displays whether the principals specified are members in \fIgroup\fR.
