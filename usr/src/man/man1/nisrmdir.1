.TH nisrmdir 1 "2 Dec 2005" "SunOS 5.11" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
nisrmdir \- remove NIS+ directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBnisrmdir\fR [\fB-if\fR] [\fB-s\fR \fIhostname\fR] \fIdirname\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBnisrmdir\fR deletes existing NIS+ subdirectories. It can remove a
directory outright, or simply remove replicas from serving a directory.
.sp
.LP
This command modifies the object that describes the directory
\fIdirname\fR, and then notifies each replica to remove the directory named
\fIdirname\fR. If the notification of any of the affected replicas fails,
the directory object is returned to its original state unless the \fB-f\fR
option is present.
.sp
.LP
This command will fail if the NIS+ master server is not running.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Interactive mode. Like the system  \fBrm\fR(1) command the \fBnisrmdir\fR
command will ask for confirmation prior to removing a directory. If the name
specified by \fIdirname\fR is a non-fully qualified name this option is
forced on. This prevents the removal of unexpected directories.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Force the command to succeed even though it may not be able to contact the
affected replicas. This option should be used when a replica is known to be
down and will not be able to respond to the removal notification. When the
replica is finally rebooted it will read the updated directory object, note
that it is no longer a replica for that directory, and stop responding to
lookups on that directory. Cleanup of the files that held the now removed
directory can be accomplished manually by removing the appropriate files in
the \fB/var/nis\fR directory. See \fBnisfiles\fR(4) for more information.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fI hostname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Specify that the host \fBhostname\fR should be removed as a replica for the
directory named \fIdirname\fR. If this option is not present \fIall\fR
replicas and the master server for a directory are removed and the directory
is removed from the namespace.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Special per-server and per-directory access restrictions may apply when
this command updates the serving lists of the affected NIS+ servers. For
more information, see \fBnisopaccess\fR(1).
.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIdirname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
An existing NIS+ directory.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUsing the \fBnisrmdir\fR Command
.sp
.LP
To remove a directory  \fBbar\fR under the  \fBfoo.com.\fR domain, one
would use the command:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBnisrmdir bar.foo.com.\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
To remove a replica that is serving directory  \fBbar.foo.com.\fR one would
use the command:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBnisrmdir -s replica.foo.com. bar.foo.com.\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
To force the removal of directory  \fBbar.foo.com.\fR from the namespace,
one would use the command:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBnisrmdir -f bar.foo.com.\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBNIS_PATH \fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
If this variable is set, and the NIS+ directory name is not fully
qualified, each directory specified will be searched until the directory is
found. See \fBnisdefaults\fR(1).
