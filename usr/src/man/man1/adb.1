.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B adb
utility is an interactive, general-purpose debugger. It can
be used to examine files and provides a controlled environment for the
execution of programs.
.sp
.LP
The
.B adb
utility is now implemented as a link to the
.BR mdb (1)
utility.
.BR mdb (1)
is a low-level debugging utility that can be used to
examine user processes as well as the live operating system or operating
system crash dumps. The new
.BR mdb (1)
utility provides complete backwards
compatibility with the existing syntax and features of
.BR adb ,
including
support for processing
.B adb
macro files. The \fISolaris Modular
Debugger Guide\fR and
.BR mdb (1)
man page describes the features of
.BR mdb ,
including its
.B adb
compatibility mode. This mode will be
activated by default when the
.B adb
link is executed.
