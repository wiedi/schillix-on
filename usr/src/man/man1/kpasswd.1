.SH NAME
kpasswd \- change a user's Kerberos password
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/kpasswd\fR [\fIprincipal\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B kpasswd
command is used to change a Kerberos principal's
password.
.B kpasswd
prompts for the current Kerberos password, which is
used to obtain a
.B changepw
ticket from the
.B KDC
for the user's
Kerberos realm. If
.B kpasswd
successfully obtains the
.BR changepw
ticket, the user is prompted twice for the new password, and the password is
changed.
.sp
.LP
If the principal is governed by a policy that specifies the length and/or
number of character classes required in the new password, the new password
must conform to the policy. (The five character classes are lower case,
upper case, numbers, punctuation, and all other characters.)
