.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBwhois\fR [\fB-h\fR \fIhost\fR] \fIidentifier\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBwhois\fR searches for an \fBInternet\fR directory entry for an
\fIidentifier\fR which is either a name (such as ``Smith'') or a handle
(such as ``SRI-NIC''). To force a name-only search, precede the name with a
period; to force a handle-only search, precede the handle with an
exclamation point.
.sp
.LP
To search for a group or organization entry, precede the argument with
\fB*\fR (an asterisk). The entire membership list of the group will be
displayed with the record.
.sp
.LP
You may of course use an exclamation point and asterisk, or a period and
asterisk together.
