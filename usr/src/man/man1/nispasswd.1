.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnispasswd\fR utility changes a password,  gecos (finger) field (\fB-g\fR
option), home directory (\fB-h\fR option),  or login shell (\fB-s\fR option)
associated with the \fIusername\fR (invoker by default) in the NIS+ passwd
table.
.sp
.LP
Additionally, the command can be used to view or modify aging information
associated with the user specified  if the invoker has the right NIS+
privileges.
.sp
.LP
\fBnispasswd\fR uses secure RPC to communicate with the NIS+ server,  and
therefore, never sends unencrypted passwords over  the communication medium.
.sp
.LP
\fBnispasswd\fR does not read or modify the local password information stored
in the \fB/etc/passwd\fR and  \fB/etc/shadow\fR files.
.sp
.LP
When used to change a password, \fBnispasswd\fR prompts non-privileged users
for their old password.  It then prompts for the new password twice to forestall
typing mistakes. When the old password is entered, \fBnispasswd\fR checks to see
if it has "aged" sufficiently. If "aging" is insufficient, \fBnispasswd\fR
terminates; see \fBgetspnam\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
The old password is used to decrypt the username's secret key. If the password
does not decrypt the secret key,  \fBnispasswd\fR prompts for the old secure-RPC
password. It uses this password to decrypt the secret key. If this fails, it
gives the user one more chance. The old password is also used to ensure that the
new password differs from the old by at least three characters. Assuming aging
is sufficient, a check is made to ensure that  the new password meets
construction requirements described below. When the new password is entered a
second time,  the two copies of the new password are compared.  If the two
copies are not identical, the cycle of prompting for  the new password is
repeated twice. The new password is used to  re-encrypt the user's secret key.
Hence, it also becomes their secure-RPC password. Therefore, the secure-RPC
password is no longer a different password from the user's password.
.sp
.LP
Passwords must be constructed to meet the following requirements:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Each password must have at least six characters.  Only the first eight
characters are significant.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Each password must contain at least two alphabetic characters and at least one
numeric or special character. In this case, "alphabetic" refers to all upper or
lower case letters.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Each password must differ from the  user's login  \fIusername\fR and any
reverse or circular shift of that login \fIusername\fR. For comparison purposes,
an upper case letter  and its corresponding lower case letter are equivalent.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
New passwords must differ from the  old by at least three characters. For
comparison purposes, an upper  case letter and its corresponding lower case
letter are equivalent.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Network administrators, who own the NIS+ password table, may change any
password attributes  if they establish their credentials (see \fBkeylogin\fR(1))
before invoking  \fBnispasswd\fR. Hence, \fBnispasswd\fR does not prompt these
privileged-users for the old password and they are not forced to comply with
password aging and password construction requirements.
.sp
.LP
Any user may use the \fB-d\fR option to display password attributes for his or
her own login name. The format of the display will be:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIusername\fR \fIstatus\fR \fImm/dd/yy\fR \fImin\fR \fImax\fR \fIwarn\fR
.fi
.in -2

or, if password aging information is not present,
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIusername\fR \fIstatus\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp

where
.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fIusername\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n

The login \fBID\fR of the user.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIstatus\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The password status of \fIusername\fR: "PS" stands for password exists or
locked, "LK" stands for locked, and "NP" stands for no password.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fImm/dd/yy\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The date password was last changed for \fIusername\fR. (Note that all password
aging dates are determined using Greenwich Mean Time (Universal Time) and,
therefore, may differ by as much as a day in other time zones.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fImin\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The minimum number of days required between password changes for
\fIusername\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fImax\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The maximum number of days the password is valid for \fIusername\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIwarn\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The number of days relative to \fImax\fR before the password expires that the
\fIusername\fR will be warned.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The use of \fBnispasswd\fR is strongly discouraged. It is a wrapper around the
\fBpasswd\fR(1) command.
.sp
.LP
Using \fBpasswd\fR(1) with the \fB-r\fR \fBnisplus\fR option will achieve the
same result and will be consistent across all the different name services
available. This is the recommended way to change the password in NIS+.
.sp
.LP
The login program, file access display programs (for example, \fBls\fR
\fB-l\fR), and network programs that require user passwords, for example,
\fBrlogin\fR(1), \fBftp\fR(1), and so on, use the standard  \fBgetpwnam\fR(3C)
and \fBgetspnam\fR(3C) interfaces to get password information. These programs
will get the NIS+ password information, which is modified by \fBnispasswd\fR,
only if the  \fBpasswd:\fR entry in the  \fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR file includes
\fBnisplus\fR. See \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4) for more details.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Shows the password attributes for all entries. This will show only the entries
in the NIS+ passwd table in the local domain that the invoker is authorized to
"read".
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR [\fIusername\fR]\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Displays password attributes for the caller or the user specified if the
invoker has the right privileges.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-D\fR \fIdomainname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Consults the \fBpasswd.org_dir\fR table in \fBdomainname\fR. If this option is
not specified, the default \fBdomainname\fR returned by
\fBnis_local_directory()\fR will be used. This \fBdomainname\fR is the same as
that returned by  \fBdomainname\fR(1M).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR

for \fIusername\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-g\fR\fR
.ad

.RE

.sp

\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n

Locks the password entry for \fIusername\fR. Subsequently,  \fBlogin\fR(1)
would disallow logins with this NIS+ password entry.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR \fImin\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Sets minimum field for \fIusername\fR. The \fImin\fR field contains the minimum
number of days  between password changes for \fIusername\fR.  If \fImin\fR is
greater than \fImax\fR, the user may not change the password. Always use this
option with the \fB-x\fR option, unless \fImax\fR is set  to \fB-1\fR (aging
turned off).  In that case, \fImin\fR need not be set.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Changes the login shell. By default, only the NIS+ administrator can change the
login shell. The user will be prompted for the new login shell.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR \fIwarn\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Sets \fIwarn\fR field for \fIusername\fR. The \fIwarn\fR field contains the
number of days before the password expires that the user will be warned whenever
he or she attempts to login.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR \fImax\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Sets maximum field for \fIusername\fR. The \fImax\fR field contains the number
of days that  the password is valid for \fIusername\fR. The aging for
\fIusername\fR will be turned off immediately  if \fImax\fR is set to \fB-1\fR.
If it is set to \fB0\fR, then the user is forced to change the password  at the
next login session and aging is turned off.
