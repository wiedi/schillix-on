.SH NAME
sccs-cdc, cdc \- change the delta commentary of an SCCS delta
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcdc\fR \fB-r\fIsid\fR [\fB-m\fImr-list\fR] [\fB-y\fR [\fIcomment\fR]] \fIs.filename\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBcdc\fR annotates the delta commentary for the \fBSCCS\fR delta ID (SID)
specified by the
.B -r
option in each named \fBs.\fRfile.
.sp
.LP
If the
.B v
flag is set in the \fBs.\fRfile, you can also use \fBcdc\fR
to update the Modification Request (MR) list.
.sp
.LP
If you checked in the delta, or, if you own the file and directory and have
write permission, you can use
.B cdc
to annotate the commentary.
.sp
.LP
Rather than replacing the existing commentary,
.B cdc
inserts the new
comment you supply, followed by a line of the form:
.sp
.LP
\fB*** CHANGED ***\fR \fIyy\fB/\fImm\fB/\fBdd\fR
\fIhh\fB/\fImm\fB/\fIss username\fR
.sp
.LP
above the existing commentary.
.sp
.LP
If a directory is named as the \fIs.filename\fR argument, the \fBcdc\fR
command applies to all \fBs.\fRfiles in that directory. Unreadable
\fBs.\fRfiles produce an error; processing continues with the next file (if
any). If `\fB\(mi\fR\&' is given as the \fIs.filename\fR argument, each line
of the standard input is taken as the name of an
.B SCCS
history file to
be processed, and the
.B -m
and
.B -y
options must be used.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp

of the delta to change.

\fB-m\fImr-list\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Specify one or more MR numbers to add or delete. When specifying more than
one MR on the command line,
.I mr-list
takes the form of a quoted,
.RB "space-separated list. To delete an MR number, precede it with a" " !"
character (an empty
.B MR
list has no effect). A list of deleted
\fBMRs\fR is placed in the comment section of the delta commentary. If
\fB-m\fR is not used and the standard input is a terminal, \fBcdc\fR prompts
with
.B MRs?
for the list (before issuing the
.B comments?
prompt).
\fB-m\fR is only useful when the \fBv\fR flag is set in the \fBs.\fRfile. If
that flag has a value, it is taken to be the name of a program to validate
the MR numbers.  If that validation program returns a non-zero exit status,
\fBcdc\fR terminates and the delta commentary remains unchanged.

.RS 15n
.rt
Use
.I comment
as the annotation in the delta commentary. The previous
comments are retained; the
.I comment
is added along with a notation that
the commentary was changed. A  null
.I comment
leaves the commentary
unaffected. If
.B -y
is not specified and the standard input is a
terminal,
.B cdc
prompts with
.B comments?
for the text of the
notation to be added.  An unescaped
.B NEWLINE
character terminates the
annotation text.
