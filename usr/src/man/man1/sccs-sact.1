If a directory name is used in place of the \fIs.filename\fR argument, the
\fBsact\fR command applies to all \fBs.\fRfiles in that directory.
Unreadable \fBs.\fRfiles produce an error; processing continues with the
next file (if any). The use of `\fB\(mi\fR\&' as the \fIs.filename\fR
argument indicates that the names of files are to be read from the standard
input, one \fBs.\fRfile per line.
