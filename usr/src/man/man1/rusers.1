.SH NAME
rusers \- who is logged in on remote machines
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBrusers\fR [\fB-ahilu\fR] \fIhost\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B rusers
command produces output similar to
.BR who (1),
but for
remote machines. The listing is in the order that responses are received,
but this order can be changed by specifying one of the options listed
below.
.sp
.LP
The default is to print out the names of the users logged in. When the
\fB-l\fR flag is given, additional information is printed for each user:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIuserid hostname\fB:\fIterminal login_date login_time idle_time login_host\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If
.I hostname
and
.I "login host"
are the same value, the
\fIlogin_host\fR field is not displayed. Likewise, if \fIhostname\fR is not
idle, the
.I idle_time
is not displayed.
.sp
.LP
A remote host will only respond if it is running the
.B rusersd
daemon,
which may be started up from
.BR inetd "(1M) or"
.BR listen (1M).
.sp
.LP
In the absence of a name service, such as LDAP or NIS, \fBrusers\fR
displays host names as numeric IP addresses.
