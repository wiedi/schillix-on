.SH NAME
rwho \- who is logged in on local machines
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBrwho\fR [\fB-a\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrwho\fR command produces output similar to \fBwho\fR(1), but for all
machines on your network.  If no report has been received from a machine for
5 minutes, \fBrwho\fR assumes the machine is down, and does not report users
last known to be logged into that machine.
.sp
.LP
If a user has not typed to the system for a minute or more, \fBrwho\fR
reports this idle time.  If a user has not typed to the system for an hour
or more, the user is omitted from the output of \fBrwho\fR unless the
\fB-a\fR flag is given.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
\fBrwho\fR does not work through gateways.
.sp
.LP
The directory \fB/var/spool/rwho\fR must exist on the host from which
\fBrwho\fR is run.
.sp
.LP
This service takes up progressively more network bandwith as the number of
hosts on the local net increases. For large networks, the cost becomes
prohibitive.
.sp
.LP
The \fBrwho\fR service daemon, \fBin.rwhod\fR(1M), must be enabled for this
command to return useful results.
