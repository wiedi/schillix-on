.SH NAME
sccs-rmdel, rmdel \- remove a delta from an SCCS file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBrmdel\fR \fB-r\fR\fIsid\fR \fIs.filename\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrmdel\fR utility removes the delta specified by the \fBSCCS\fR delta
\fBID\fR (\fBSID\fR) supplied with \fB-r\fR. The delta to be removed must be
the most recent (leaf) delta in its branch. In addition, the \fBSID\fR must
\fInot\fR be that of a version checked out for editing: it must not appear
in any entry of the version lock file (\fBp.\fRfile).
.sp
.LP
If you created the delta, or, if you own the file and directory and have
write permission, you can remove it with \fBrmdel\fR.
.sp
.LP
If a directory name is used in place of the \fIs.filename\fR argument, the
\fBrmdel\fR command applies to all \fBs.\fRfiles in that directory.
Unreadable \fBs.\fRfiles produce an error; processing continues with the
next file (if any). The use of `\fB\(mi\fR\&' as the \fIs.filename\fR
argument indicates that the names of files are to be read from the standard
input, one \fBs.\fRfile per line.
