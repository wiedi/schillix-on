.TH runat 1 "22 Jun 2001" "SunOS 5.11" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
runat \- execute command in extended attribute name space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/runat\fR \fIfile\fR [\fIcommand\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B runat
utility is used to execute shell commands in a file's
hidden attribute directory. Effectively, this utility changes the current
working directory to be the hidden attribute directory associated with the
file argument and then executes the specified command in the bourne shell
(\fB/bin/sh\fR). If no command argument is provided, an interactive shell is
spawned. The environment variable $\fBSHELL\fR defines the shell to be
spawned. If this variable is undefined, the default shell,
.BR /bin/sh ,
is
used.
.sp
.LP
The file argument can be any file, including a directory, that can support
extended attributes. It is not necessary that this file have any attributes,
or be prepared in any way, before invoking the
.B runat
command.
.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIfile\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
Any file, including a directory, that can support extended attributes.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I command
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The command to be executed in an attribute directory.
.RE

.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
A non-zero exit status will be returned if
.B runat
cannot access the
\fIfile\fR argument, or the \fIfile\fR argument does not support extended
attributes.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
See
.BR fsattr (5)
for a detailed description of extended file
attributes.
.sp
.LP
The process context created by the
.B runat
command has its current
working directory set to the hidden directory containing the file's extended
attributes. The parent of this directory (the "\fB\&..\fR" entry) always
refers to the file provided on the command line. As such, it may not be a
directory. Therefore, commands (such as
.BR pwd )
that depend upon the
parent entry being well-formed (that is, referring to a directory) may
fail.
.sp
.LP
In the absence of the
.I command
argument,
.B runat
will spawn a new
interactive shell with its current working directory set to be the provided
file's hidden attribute directory. Notice that some shells (such as
\fBzsh\fR and
.BR tcsh )
are not well behaved when the directory parent is
not a directory, as described above. These shells should not be used with
.BR runat .
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1\fR Using runat to list extended attributes on a file
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBrunat file.1 ls -l\fR
example% \fBrunat file.1 ls\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2\fR Creating extended attributes
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBrunat file.2 cp /tmp/attrdata attr.1\fR
example% \fBrunat file.2 cat /tmp/attrdata > attr.1\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3\fR Copying an attribute from one file to another
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBrunat file.2 cat attr.1 | runat file.1 "cat > attr.1"\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 4\fR Using runat to spawn an interactive shell
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBrunat file.3 /bin/sh\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
This spawns a new shell in the attribute directory for
.BR file.3 .
Notice
that the shell will not be able to determine what your current directory is.
To leave the attribute directory, either exit the spawned shell or change
directory (\fBcd\fR) using an absolute path.

.LP
The above list includes commands that are known to work with
.BR runat .
While many other commands may work, there is no guarantee that any beyond
this list will work. Any command that relies on being able to determine its
current working directory is likely to fail. Examples of such commands
follow:
.LP
\fBExample 5\fR Using man in an attribute directory
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBrunat file.1 man runat\fR
>getcwd: Not a directory
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 6\fR Spawning a tcsh shell in an attribute directory
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBrunat file.3 /usr/bin/tcsh\fR
tcsh: Not a directory
tcsh: Trying to start from "/home/\fIuser\fR"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
A new tcsh shell has been spawned with the current working directory set to
the user's home directory.

.LP
\fBExample 7\fR Spawning a zsh shell in an attribute directory
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBrunat file.3 /usr/bin/zsh\fR
example%
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
While the command appears to have worked,
.B zsh
has actually just
changed the current working directory to '/'. This can be seen by using
.BR /bin/pwd :

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fB/bin/pwd\fR
/
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B SHELL
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
Specifies the command shell to be invoked by
.BR runat .
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B 125
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt
The attribute directory of the file referenced by the \fIfile\fR argument
cannot be accessed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B 126
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt
The exec of the provided
.I command
argument failed.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Otherwise, the exit status returned is the exit status of the shell invoked
to execute the provided command.

.BR attributes (5)

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
It is not always obvious why a command fails in
.B runat
when it is
unable to determine the current working directory. The errors resulting can
be confusing and ambiguous (see the
.B tcsh
and
.B zsh
examples
above).
