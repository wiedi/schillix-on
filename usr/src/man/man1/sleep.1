.SH NAME
sleep \- suspend execution for an interval
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS "/usr/bin/sleep"
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/sleep\fR \fIseconds\fR
.fi

.SS "ksh93"
.LP
.nf
\fBsleep\fR \fIseconds\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBsleep\fR suspends execution for at least the time in seconds specified
by
.I seconds
or until a
.B SIGALRM
signal is received. The
\fIseconds\fR operand can be specified as a floating point number but the
actual granularity normally depends on the underlying system.
.SH OPERANDS
.SS "/usr/bin/sleep"
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported for
.B /usr/bin/sleep
and
\fBksh93\fR's \fBsleep\fR built-in command:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I seconds
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
A non-negative floating-point number specifying the number of seconds for
which to suspend execution. The floating-point number may be specified in
all formats required by C99/XPG6, including constants such as "Inf" or
"infinite".
.RE

.SS "ksh93"
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I time
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt
Specify
.I time
in seconds as a floating point number. The actual
granularity depends on the underlying system, normally around 1
millisecond.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1\fR Suspending Command Execution
.sp
.LP
The following example executes a command after a certain amount of time:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fB(sleep 105; \fIcommand\fR)&\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2\fR Executing a Command Every So Often
.sp
.LP
The following example executes a command every so often:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBwhile true
do
        \fIcommand\fR
        sleep 37
done\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3\fR Suspend command execution forever (or until a \fBSIGALRM\fR
signal is received)
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% sleep Inf
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 4\fR Suspending command execution for 0.5 seconds
.sp
.LP
Suspending command execution for 0.5 seconds using an alternative
floating-point representation for the value "0.5"

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% printf "%a\en" 0.5
0x1.0000000000000000000000000000p-01
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B 0
.ad

The execution was successfully suspended for at least
.I time
seconds,
or a
.B SIGALRM
signal was received (see NOTES).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If the
.B sleep
utility receives a
.B SIGALRM
signal, one of the
following actions is taken:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Terminate normally with a zero exit status.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Effectively ignore the signal.
.RE
.sp
.LP
The
.B sleep
utility takes the standard action for all other signals.
.sp
.LP
The behavior for input values such as "NaN" (not-a-number) or negative
values is undefined.
