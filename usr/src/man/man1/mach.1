\fBmach\fR and  \fBuname\fR \fB-p\fR return equivalent values; therefore,
Independent Software Vendors (ISV) and  others who need to ascertain
processor type are encouraged to use \fBuname\fR with the  \fB-p\fR option
instead of the \fBmach\fR command. The  \fBmach\fR command is provided for
compatibility with previous releases, but generally its use is
discouraged.
