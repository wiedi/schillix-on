.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
\fBmach\fR and  \fBuname -p\fR return equivalent values; therefore,
Independent Software Vendors (ISV) and  others who need to ascertain
processor type are encouraged to use
.B uname
with the
.B -p
option
instead of the
.B mach
command. The
.B mach
command is provided for
compatibility with previous releases, but generally its use is
discouraged.
