.TH pklogin_finder 1 "17 Jul 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
pklogin_finder \- map certificates into a user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/pam_pkcs11/pklogin_finder\fR [debug] [config_file=\fIfilename\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpklogin_finder\fR uses the \fBpam_pkcs11\fR library infrastructure to
interactively map a PKCS#11 provided certificate to a user.
.sp
.LP
\fBpklogin_finder\fR uses the same configuration file and arguments than
.BR pam_pkcs11 (5)
PAM module. It loads defined mapper modules and tries to
find a map between found certificates and a user login.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBconfig_file=\fIfileame\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
Set the configuration file.
.sp
The default value is
.BR /etc/security/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf .
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B debug
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
Enable debugging output.
.sp
The default is no debug.
.RE

.sp
.LP
As it uses the same configuration file as
.BR pam_pkcs11 (5),
all of the
\fBpam_pkcs11\fR options are available. Some of these options make no sense
in a non-PAM environment, and are therefore ignored. Some mapper options
(\fBmapfile\fR,
.BR ignorecase )
have no effect on certificate contents,
and they are ignored as well.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B 0
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
Successful completion.
.sp
\fBpkcs11_inspect\fR prints on \fBstdout\fR the login name and exits.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B 1
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
