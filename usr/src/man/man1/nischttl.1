.SH NAME
nischttl \- change the time to live value of a NIS+ object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBnischttl\fR [\fB-AfLP\fR] \fItime\fR \fIname\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBnischttl\fR changes the time to live value (\fBttl\fR) of the NIS+ objects
or entries specified by \fIname\fR to \fItime\fR. Entries are specified using
indexed names (see \fBnismatch\fR(1)).
.sp
.LP
The time to live value is used by object caches to expire objects within their
cache. When an object is read into the cache, this value is added to the
current time in seconds yielding the time when the cached object would expire.
The object may be returned from the cache until the current time is earlier
than the calculated expiration time. When the expiration time has been reached,
the object will be  flushed from the cache.
.sp
.LP
The time to live \fItime\fR may be specified in seconds or in days, hours,
minutes, seconds format. The latter format uses a suffix letter of \fBd\fR,
\fBh\fR, \fBm\fR, or \fBs\fR to identify the units of time. See the examples
below for usage.
.sp
.LP
The command will fail if the master NIS+ server is not running.
.sp
.LP
Setting a high  \fBttl\fR value allows objects to stay persistent in caches
for a longer period of time and can improve performance. However, when an
object changes, in the worst case, the number of seconds in this attribute must
pass before that change is visible to all clients. Setting a  \fBttl\fR value
of \fB0\fR means that the object should not be cached at all.
.sp
.LP
A high  \fBttl\fR value is a week, a low value is less than a minute. Password
entries should have  \fBttl\fR values of about 12 hours (easily allows one
password change per day),  entries in the RPC table can have  \fBttl\fR values
of several weeks (this information is effectively unchanging).
.sp
.LP
Only directory and group objects are cached in this implementation.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-A\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Modify all tables in the concatenation path that match the search criterion
specified in \fIname\fR. This option implies the \fB-P\fR switch.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-f\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Force the operation and fail silently if it does not succeed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-L\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Follow links and change the time to live of the linked object or entries
rather than the  time to live of the link itself.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-P\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Follow the concatenation path within a named table. This option only makes
sense when either \fIname\fR is an indexed name or the \fB-L\fR switch is also
specified and the named object is a link pointing to entries.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRChanging the \fBttl\fR of an Object
.sp
.LP
The following example shows how to change the  \fBttl\fR of an  object using
the seconds format and the days, hours, minutes, seconds format. The  \fBttl\fR
of the second object is set to 1 day and 12 hours.

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRChanging the \fBttl\fR for a password Entry
.sp
.LP
This example shows how to change the  \fBttl\fR for a password entry.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBnischttl 1h30m '[uid=99],passwd.org_dir'\fR
.fi

.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRChanging the \fBttl\fR of Entries Pointed to by a Link
.sp
.LP
The next two examples change the  \fBttl\fR of the object or entries pointed
to by a link, and the  \fBttl\fR of all entries in the \fBhobbies\fR table.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBnischttl -L 12h linkname\fR

If this variable is set, and the \fBNIS+\fR name is not fully qualified, each
directory specified will be searched until the object is found. See
\fBnisdefaults\fR(1).

.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.LP
NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating
system. Tools to aid the migration from NIS+ to LDAP are available in the
current Solaris release. For more information, visit
