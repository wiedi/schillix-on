.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
The \fBclear\fR utility clears the terminal screen if this is possible. It
looks in the environment for the terminal type, if this is not already
specified by the \fIterm\fR operand, and then looks up the terminfo database
to figure out how to clear the screen.

because the default is taken from the environment variable \fBTERM\fR.
