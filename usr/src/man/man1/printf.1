.SS "/usr/bin/printf"

.LP
The \fBprintf\fR utility writes each string operand to standard output
using \fIformat\fR to control the output format.
.SH OPERANDS

.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported by \fB/usr/bin/printf\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fIformat\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
A string describing the format to use to write the remaining operands. The
\fIformat\fR operand is used as the \fIformat\fR string described on the
\fBformats\fR(5) manual page, with the following exceptions:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A

character in the format string, in any context other than a
flag of a conversion specification, is treated as an ordinary character that
is copied to the output.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu

A character in the format string is treated as a character, not as a
\fBSPACE\fR character.

In addition to the escape sequences described on the \fBformats\fR(5)
manual page (\fB\e\e\fR, \fB\ea\fR, \fB\eb\fR, \fB\ef\fR, \fB\en\fR,
\fB\er\fR, \fB\et\fR, \fB\ev\fR), \fB\e\fIddd\fR, where \fIddd\fR is a
one-, two- or three-digit octal number, is written as a byte with the
numeric value specified by the octal number.
.RE

.TP
.ie t \(bu

\fIformat\fR operand.
.RE

An additional conversion character,

represent
.RE

.ie t \(bu

\fB\e0\fIddd\fR, where \fIddd\fR is a zero-, one-, two- or three-digit
octal number that is converted to a byte with the numeric value specified by
the octal number
.RE

.ie t \(bu

\fB\ec\fR, which is written and causes \fBprintf\fR to ignore any remaining
characters in the string operand containing it, any remaining string
operands and any additional characters in the \fIformat\fR operand.
.RE
.RE
The interpretation of a backslash followed by any other sequence of
characters is unspecified.
.sp
Bytes from the converted string are written until the end of the string or
the number of bytes indicated by the precision specification is reached. If
the precision is omitted, it is taken to be infinite, so all bytes up to the
end of the converted string are written. For each specification that
consumes an argument, the next argument operand is evaluated and converted
to the appropriate type for the conversion as specified below. The
\fIformat\fR operand is reused as often as necessary to satisfy the argument
operands. Any extra
.B c
or
.B s
conversion specifications are
evaluated as if a null string argument were supplied; other extra conversion
specifications are evaluated as if a zero argument were supplied. If the
\fIformat\fR operand contains no conversion specifications and
\fIargument\fR operands are present, the results are unspecified. If a
character sequence in the \fIformat\fR operand begins with a \fB%\fR
character, but does not form a valid conversion specification, the behavior
is unspecified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I argument
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The strings to be written to standard output, under the control of
\fBformat\fR. The \fIargument\fR operands are treated as strings if the
corresponding conversion character is
.BR b ,
\fBc\fR or \fBs\fR.
Otherwise, it is evaluated as a C constant, as described by the ISO C
standard, with the following extensions:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A leading plus or minus sign is allowed.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If the leading character is a single- or double-quote, the value is the
numeric value in the underlying codeset of the character following the
single- or double-quote.
.RE
If an argument operand cannot be completely converted into an internal
value appropriate to the corresponding conversion specification, a
diagnostic message is written to standard error and the utility does not
exit with a zero exit status, but continues processing any remaining
operands and writes the value accumulated at the time the error was detected
to standard output.

When performing conversions of

If there are more
.I string
operands than format specifiers, the format
string is reprocessed from the beginning. If there are fewer \fIstring\fR

\fB0\fR was supplied, and time conversions are treated as if \fBnow\fR was
supplied.
.sp
.LP
\fB/usr/bin/printf\fR is equivalent to \fBksh93\fR's \fBprintf\fR built-in
and
.BR "print -f" ,
which allows additional options to be specified.
.SH USAGE
.SS "/usr/bin/printf"
.sp
.LP
The \fBprintf\fR utility, like the \fBprintf\fR(3C) function on which it is
based, makes no special provision for dealing with multi-byte characters
when using the
.B %c
conversion specification. Applications should be
extremely cautious using either of these features when there are multi-byte
characters in the character set.
.sp
.LP
Field widths and precisions cannot be specified as
.BR * .
.sp
.LP
The
.B %b
conversion specification is not part of the ISO C standard; it
has been added here as a portable way to process backslash escapes expanded
in string operands as provided by the
.B echo
utility. See also the USAGE
section of the
.BR echo (1)
manual page for ways to use \fBprintf\fR as a
replacement for all of the traditional versions of the
.B echo
utility.
.sp
.LP
If an argument cannot be parsed correctly for the corresponding conversion
specification, the \fBprintf\fR utility reports an error. Thus, overflow and
extraneous characters at the end of an argument being used for a numeric
conversion are to be reported as errors.
.sp
.LP
It is not considered an error if an argument operand is not completely used
for a
.B c
or
.B s
conversion or if a string operand's first or second
character is used to get the numeric value of a character.
