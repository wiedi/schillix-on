.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdate\fR utility writes the date and time to standard output or
attempts to set the system date and time. By default, the current date and
time is written.
.sp
.LP
Specifications of native language translations of month and weekday names
are supported. The month and weekday names used for a language are based on
the locale specified by the environment variable \fBLC_TIME\fR. See
\fBenviron\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
The following is the default form for the "C" locale:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fI%a %b %e %T %Z %Y\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
For example,
.sp
.in +2
.nf
Fri Dec 23 10:10:42 EST 1988
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR [\|\fB-\fR\|]\|\fIsss.fff\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 24n
.rt
Slowly adjust the time by \fIsss\fR.\fIfff\fR seconds (\fIfff\fR represents
fractions of a second). This adjustment can be positive or negative. The
system's clock is sped up or slowed down until it has drifted by the number
of seconds specified. Only the super-user may adjust the time.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 24n
.rt
Display (or set) the date in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT\(emuniversal time),
bypassing the normal conversion to (or from) local time.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB+\fR\fIformat\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
If the argument begins with \fB+\fR, the output of \fBdate\fR is the result
of passing \fIformat\fR and the current time to \fBstrftime()\fR. \fBdate\fR
uses the conversion specifications listed on the \fBstrftime\fR(3C) manual
page, with the conversion specification for \fB%C\fR determined by whether
\fB/usr/bin/date\fR or \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/date\fR is used:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB/usr/bin/date\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
Locale's date and time representation. This is the default output for
\fBdate\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
Century (a year divided by 100 and truncated to an integer) as a decimal
number [00-99].
.RE

The string is always terminated with a NEWLINE. An argument containing
blanks must be quoted; see the EXAMPLES section.

\fB20\fR for the year 2007.

Last two digits of the year number. If century (\fIcc\fR) is not specified,
then values in the range \fB69-99\fR shall refer to years 1969 to 1999
inclusive, and values in the range \fB00-68\fR shall refer to years 2000 to
2068, inclusive.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The month, day, year number, and century may be omitted; the current values
are applied as defaults. For example, the following entry:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBdate 10080045\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
sets the date to Oct 8, 12:45 a.m. The current year is the default because
no year is supplied. The system operates in GMT. \fBdate\fR takes care of
the conversion to and from local standard and daylight time. Only the
super-user may change the date. After successfully setting the date and
time, \fBdate\fR displays the new date according to the default format. The
\fBdate\fR command uses \fBTZ\fR to determine the correct time zone
information; see \fBenviron\fR(5).
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRGenerating Output
.sp
.LP
The following command:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBdate '+DATE: %m/%d/%y%nTIME:%H:%M:%S'\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP

.sp

TIME: 14:45:05
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRSetting the Current Time
.sp
.LP
The following command sets the current time to \fB12:34:56\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fBdate 1234.56\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRSetting Another Time and Date in Greenwich Mean Time
.sp
.LP
The following command sets the date to January 1st, 12:30 am, 2000:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fBdate -u 010100302000\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
This is displayed as:

.sp

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment
variables that affect the execution of \fBdate\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR,
\fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_TIME\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.sp

Determine the timezone in which the time and date are written, unless the
\fB-u\fR option is specified. If the \fBTZ\fR variable is not set and the
\fB-u\fR is not specified, the system default timezone is used.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If you attempt to set the current date to one of the dates that the
standard and alternate time zones change (for example, the date that
daylight time is starting or ending), and you attempt to set the time to a
time in the interval between the end of standard time and the beginning of
the alternate time (or the end of the alternate time and the beginning of
standard time), the results are unpredictable.
.sp
.LP
Using the \fBdate\fR command from within windowing environments to change
the date can lead to unpredictable results and is unsafe. It can also be
unsafe in the multi-user mode, that is, outside of a windowing system, if
the date is changed rapidly back and forth. The recommended method of
changing the date is '\fBdate\fR \fB-a\fR'.
.sp
.LP
Setting the system time or allowing the system time to progress beyond
\fB03:14:07 UTC Jan 19, 2038\fR is not supported on Solaris.
