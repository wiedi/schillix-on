.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B ssh-keygen
utility generates, manages, and converts authentication
keys for
.BR ssh (1).
.B ssh-keygen
can create RSA keys for use by SSH
protocol version 1 and RSA or DSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 2. The
type of key to be generated is specified with the
.B -t
option.
.sp
.LP
Normally, each user wishing to use
.B SSH
with
.B RSA
or
.BR DSA
authentication runs this once to create the authentication key in
.BR $HOME/.ssh/identity ,
.BR $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa ,
or
.BR $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa .
The system administrator can also use this to generate host keys..
.sp
.LP
Ordinarily, this program generates the key and asks for a file in which to
store
the private key. The public key is stored in a file with the same name but with
the ``\fB\&.pub\fR'' extension appended. The program also asks for a
passphrase.
The passphrase can be empty to indicate no passphrase (host keys must have empty
passphrases), or it can be a string of arbitrary length. Good passphrases are
10-30 characters long, are not simple sentences or otherwise easy to guess, and
contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric
characters. (English prose has only 1-2 bits of entropy per word and provides
very poor passphrases.) If a passphrase is set, it must be at least 4
characters
long.
.sp
.LP
The passphrase can be changed later by using the
.B -p
option.
.sp
.LP
There is no way to recover a lost passphrase. If the passphrase is lost or
forgotten, you have to generate a new key and copy the corresponding public key
to other machines.
.sp
.LP
For
.BR RSA ,
there is also a comment field in the key file that is only for
convenience to the user to help identify the key. The
.I comment
can tell what
the key is for, or whatever is useful. The comment is initialized to
.RB `` user@host ''
when the key is created, but can be changed using the
.B -c
option.
.sp
.LP
After a key is generated, instructions below detail where to place the keys to
activate them.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -b
.I bits
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. The minimum number is 512
bits. Generally, 1024 bits is considered sufficient. Key sizes above that no
longer improve security but make things slower. The default is 1024 bits.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -B
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
Shows the bubblebabble digest of the specified private or public key file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -c
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
Requests changing the comment in the private and public key files. The program
prompts for the file containing the private keys, for the passphrase if the key
has one, and for the new comment.
.sp
This option only applies to
.B rsa1
.RB ( SSHv1 )
keys.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -C
.I comment
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
Provides the new comment.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -e
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
This option reads a private or public OpenSSH key file and prints the key in a
"SECSH" Public Key File Format to stdout. This option allows exporting keys for
use by several other SSH implementations.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -f
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
Specifies the filename of the key file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -F
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
Search for the specified
.I hostname
in a
.B known_hosts
file, listing any
occurrences found. This option is useful to find hashed host names or addresses
and can also be used in conjunction with the
.B -H
option to print found keys
in a hashed format.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -H
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
Hash a
.B known_hosts
file. This replaces all host names and addresses with
hashed representations within the specified file. The original content is moved
to a file with a \fB\&.old\fR suffix. These hashes may be used normally by
.B ssh
and
.BR sshd ,
but they do not reveal identifying information should
the file's contents be disclosed. This option does not modify existing hashed
host names and is therefore safe to use on files that mix hashed and non-hashed
names.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -i
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
This option reads an unencrypted private (or public) key file in SSH2-compatible
format and prints an OpenSSH compatible private (or public) key to stdout.
\fBssh-keygen\fR also reads the "SECSH" Public Key File Format. This option
allows importing keys from several other SSH implementations.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -l
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
Shows the fingerprint of the specified private or public key file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.na
.B -N
.I new_passphrase

.RS 21n
.rt
Provides the new passphrase.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -p
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
Requests changing the passphrase of a private key file instead of creating a
new
private key. The program prompts for the file containing the private key, for
the
old passphrase, and prompts twice for the new passphrase.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -P
.I passphrase
.ad
.RS 21n

Specifies the algorithm used for the key, where
.I type
is one of

.BR dsa ,
and
.BR rsa1 .
Type
.B rsa1
is used only for the SSHv1 protocol.

.na
.B -R
.I hostname
