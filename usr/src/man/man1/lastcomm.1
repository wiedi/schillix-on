\fBlastcomm\fR [\fB-f\fR \fIfile\fR] [\fB-x\fR] [\fIcommand-name\fR] .\|.\|. [\fIuser-name\fR] .\|.\|.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B lastcomm
command gives information on previously executed
commands.
.B lastcomm
with no arguments displays information about all
the commands recorded during the current accounting file's lifetime. If
called with arguments,
.B lastcomm
only displays accounting entries with
a matching
.IR command-name ,
.IR user-name ,
or
.IR terminal-name .
If
extended process accounting is active (see
.BR acctadm (1M))
and is
recording the appropriate data items,
.B lastcomm
attempts to take data
from the current extended process accounting file. If standard process
accounting is active,
.B lastcomm
takes data from the current standard
accounting file (see
.BR acct (2)).
.sp
.LP
If
.I terminal-name
is `\fB- -\fR', there was no controlling \fBTTY\fR
for the process. The process was probably executed during boot time. If
.I terminal-name
is `\fB??\fR', the controlling
.B TTY
could not be
decoded into a printable name.
.sp
.LP
For each process entry,
.B lastcomm
displays the following items of
information:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
