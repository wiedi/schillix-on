.SH NAME
mconnect \- connect to SMTP mail server socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBmconnect\fR [\fB-p\fR \fIport\fR] [\fB-r\fR] [\fIhostname\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmconnect\fR utility opens a connection to the mail server on a given
host, so that it can be tested independently of all other mail software. If
no host is given, the connection is made to the local host. Servers expect
to speak the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (\fBSMTP\fR) on this connection.
Exit by typing the \fBquit\fR command. Typing \fBEOF\fR sends an end of file
to the server. An interrupt closes the connection immediately and exits.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-p\fIport\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Specify the port number instead of the default \fBSMTP\fR port (number 25)
as the next argument.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-r\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
\fBRaw\fR mode: disable the default line buffering and input handling. This
produces an effect similar to  \fBtelnet\fR(1) to port number 25.
