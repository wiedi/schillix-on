.TH pkcs11_inspect 1 "16 Jul 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
pkcs11_inspect \- print certificate contents
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/pam_pkcs11/pkcs11_inspect\fR [debug] [config_file=\fIfilename\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkcs11_inspect\fR uses the \fBpam_pkcs11\fR library infrastructure to
obtain the content of a certificate and display it.
.sp
.LP
\fBpkcs11_inspect\fR uses the same configuration file and arguments as the
\fBpam_pkcs11\fR(5) PAM module. It loads defined mapper modules, and uses
them to look into the certificate for required entries, that is,
\fBms_mapper\fR looks for \fBms UPN\fR entries, and so forth.
.sp
.LP
When a mapper module finds a proper entry in the certificate, it converts
to \fBUTF-8\fR and prints it to \fBstdout\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBconfig_file=\fR\fIfileame\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
Set the configuration file. The default value is
\fB/etc/security/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBdebug\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
Enable debugging output.
.RE

.sp
.LP
As it uses the same configuration file as \fBpam_pkcs11\fR(5), all of the
\fBpam_pkcs11\fR options are available. Some of these options make no sense
in a non-PAM environment, and are therefore ignored. Some mapper options
(\fBmapfile\fR, \fBignorecase\fR) have no effect on certificate contents,
and they are ignored as well.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
Successful completion.
.sp
\fBpkcs11_inspect\fR prints on \fBstdout\fR all certificate contents that
are found for mappers.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB1\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
An error occurred.
