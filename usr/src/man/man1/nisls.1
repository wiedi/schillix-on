.SH NAME
nisls \- list the contents of a NIS+ directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBnisls\fR [\fB-dglLmMR\fR] [\fIname\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
For each \fIname\fR that is a NIS+ directory, \fBnisls\fR lists the
contents of the directory. For each \fIname\fR that is a NIS+ object other
than a directory, \fBnisls\fR simply echos the name. If no \fIname\fR is
specified, the first directory in the search path is listed. See
\fBnisdefaults\fR(1).
.SH OPTIONS
.sp

The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR

.mk
.na
\fB\fB-L\fR\fR
