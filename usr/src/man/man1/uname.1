.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBuname\fR utility prints information about the current system on the
standard output. When options are specified, symbols representing one or
more system characteristics will be written to the standard output. If no
options are specified, \fBuname\fR prints the current operating system's
name. The options print selected information returned by \fBuname\fR(2),
\fBsysinfo\fR(2), or both.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-a\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Prints basic information currently available from the system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-i\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Prints the name of the platform.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-m\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Prints the machine hardware name (class). Use of this option is
discouraged. Use \fBuname\fR \fB-p\fR instead. See NOTES section below.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-n\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Prints the nodename (the nodename is the name by which the system is known
to a communications network).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB-p\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Prints the current host's \fBISA\fR or processor type.
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-S\fR \fIsystem_name\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
The nodename may be changed by specifying a system name argument. The
system name argument is restricted to \fBSYS_NMLN\fR characters.
\fBSYS_NMLN\fR is an implementation specific value defined in
\fB<sys/utsname.h>\fR\&. Only the super-user is allowed this capability.
This change does not persist across reboots of the system. Use
\fBsys-unconfig\fR(1M) to change a host's name permanently.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRPrinting the OS name and release level
.sp
.LP
The following command:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBuname \(misr\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
prints the operating system name and release level, separated by one SPACE
character.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment
variables that affect the execution of \fBuname\fR: \fBLANG\fR,
\fBLC_ALL\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBSYSV3\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
This variable is used to override the default behavior of \fBuname\fR. This
is necessary to make it possible for some INTERACTIVE UNIX Systems and SCO
UNIX programs and scripts to work properly. Many scripts use \fBuname\fR to
determine the \fBSYSV3\fR type or the version of the \fBOS\fR to ensure
software is compatible with that \fBOS\fR. Setting \fBSYSV3\fR to an empty
string will make \fBuname\fR print the following default values:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
nodename nodename 3.2 2 i386
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The individual elements that \fBuname\fR displays can also be modified by
setting \fBSYSV3\fR in the following format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIos,sysname,node,rel,ver,mach\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Independent software vendors (\fBISV\fRs) and others who need to determine
detailed characteristics of the platform on which their software is either
being installed or executed should use the \fBuname\fR command.
.sp
.LP
To determine the operating system name and release level, use \fBuname
\fB-sr\fR. To determine only the operating system release level, use
\fBuname \fB-r\fR. Notice that operating system release levels are not
guaranteed to be in \fIx.y\fR format (such as 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, and so forth);
future releases could be in the \fIx.y.z\fR format (such as 5.3.1, 5.3.2,
5.4.1, and so forth).
.sp
.LP
In SunOS 4.\fIx\fR releases, the \fBarch\fR(1) command was often used to
obtain information similar to that obtained by using the \fBuname\fR
command. The \fBarch\fR(1) command output "sun4" was often incorrectly
interpreted to signify a SunOS SPARC system. If hardware platform
information is desired, use \fBuname \fB-sp\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBarch\fR \fB-k\fR and \fBuname\fR \fB-m\fR commands return equivalent
values; however, the use of either of these commands by third party programs
is discouraged, as is the use of the \fBarch\fR command in general. To
determine the machine's Instruction Set Architecture (\fBISA\fR or processor
type), use \fBuname\fR with the \fB-p\fR option.
