.SH NAME
fmli \- invoke FMLI
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBfmli\fR [\fB-a\fR \fIalias_file\fR] [\fB-c\fR \fIcommand_file\fR]
     [\fB-i\fR \fIinitialization_file\fR] \fIfilename\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B fmli
command invokes the Form and Menu Language Interpreter and
opens the frame(s) specified by the
.I filename
argument. The
.I filename
argument is the pathname of the initial frame definition
file(s), and must follow the naming convention
.BI Menu. xxx,
.BI Form. xxx,
or \fBText.\fIxxx\fR for a menu, form or text frame
respectively, where
.I xxx
is any string that conforms to
.BR UNIX
system file naming conventions. The
.B FMLI
descriptor
.B lifetime
will
be ignored for all frames opened by argument to
.BR fmli .
These frames have
a lifetime of
.B immortal
by default.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.BI -a " alias_file"
.ad
.RS 26n
.rt
If
.B -a
is specified,
.I alias_file
is the name of a file which
contains lines of the form \fBalias=\fIpathname\fR. Thereafter,
.B $alias
can be used in definition files to simplify references to
objects or devices with lengthy  pathnames, or to define a search path
(similar to
.B $PATH
in the
.B UNIX
system shell).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.BI -c " command_file"
.ad
.RS 26n
.rt
If
.B -c
is specified,
.I command_file
is the name of a file in which
default
.B FMLI
commands can be disabled, and new application-specific
commands can be defined. The contents of
.I command_file
are reflected in
the
.B FMLI
Command Menu.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.BI -i " initialization_file"
.ad
.RS 26n
.rt
If
.B -i
is specified,
.I initialization_file
is the name of a file in
which the following characteristics of the application as a whole can be
specified:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\(mi\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt
A transient introductory frame displaying product information
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
.B Example 1
Examples of the
.B fmli
command.
.sp
.LP
To invoke
.BR fmli :

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBexample% fmli Menu.start\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where
.B Menu.start
is an example of
.I filename
named according to the
file name conventions for menu definition files explained above.

.sp
.LP
To invoke
.B fmli
and name an initialization file:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBexample% fmli -i init.myapp Menu.start\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where
.B init.myapp
is an example of
.IR initialization_file .

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.SS "Variables"
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B LOADPFK
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Leaving this environment variable unset tells FMLI, for certain terminals
like the AT&T 5620 and 630, to download its equivalent character sequences for
using function keys into the terminal's programmable function keys, wiping out
any settings the user may already have set in the function keys. Setting
.B LOADPFK=NO
in the environment will prevent this downloading.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B COLUMNS
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Can be used to override the width of the logical screen defined for the
terminal set in
.BR TERM .
For terminals with a 132-column mode, for example,
invoking
.B FMLI
with the line
.sp
.BI "COLUMNS=132 fmli " frame-file
.sp
will allow this wider screen width to be used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B LINES
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Can be used to override the length of the logical screen defined for the
terminal set in
.BR TERM .

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.LP
If \fIfilename\fR is not supplied to the
.B fmli
command, \fBfmli\fR
returns the message:
.sp
.LP
.B Initial object must be specified.
.sp
.LP
If \fIfilename\fR does not exist or is not readable,
.B fmli
returns an
error message and exits. The example command line above returns the following
message and exits:
.sp
.LP
\fBCan't open object "Menu.start"\fR
.sp
.LP
If
.I filename
exists, but does not start with one of the three correct
object names
.RB ( Menu. ,
.BR Form. ,
or
.BR Text. )
or if it is named
correctly but does not contain the proper data,
.B fmli
starts to build the
screen by putting out the screen labels for function keys, after which it
flashes the message:
.sp
.LP
.B "I do not recognize that kind of object
.sp
.LP
and then exits.
