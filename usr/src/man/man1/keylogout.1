.TH keylogout 1 "2 Dec 2005" "SunOS 5.11" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
keylogout \- delete stored secret key with keyserv
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/keylogout\fR [\fB-f\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBkeylogout\fR deletes the key stored by the key server process
\fBkeyserv\fR(1M). Further access to the key is revoked; however, current
session keys might remain valid until they expire or are refreshed.
.sp
.LP
Deleting the keys stored by \fBkeyserv\fR causes any background jobs or
scheduled \fBat\fR(1) jobs that need secure RPC services to fail. Since only
one copy of the key is kept on a machine, it is a bad idea to place a call
to this command in your  \fB\&.logout\fR file since it affects other
sessions on the same machine.
.sp
.LP
If multiple NIS+ authentication mechanisms are configured for the system,
then all keys stored by the key server process is deleted, including  keys
that are no longer configured.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Force \fBkeylogout\fR to delete the secret key for the superuser. By
default, \fBkeylogout\fR by the superuser is disallowed because it would
break all RPC services, such as  \fBNFS,\fR that are started by the
superuser.
