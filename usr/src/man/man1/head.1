.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS "/usr/bin/head"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "/usr/bin/head"
.sp
.LP
The \fBhead\fR utility copies the first \fInumber\fR of lines of each
\fIfilename\fR to the standard output. If no \fIfilename\fR is given,
\fBhead\fR copies lines from the standard input. The default value of
\fInumber\fR is \fB10\fR lines.
.sp
.LP
When more than one file is specified, the start of each file looks like:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB==>\fR \fIfilename\fR \fB<==\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Thus, a common way to display a set of short files, identifying each one,
is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBhead -9999 filename1 filename2 ...\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SS "ksh93"
.sp
.LP
The \fBhead\fR built-in in \fBksh93\fR is associated with the \fB/bin\fR
and \fB/usr/bin\fR paths. It is invoked when \fBhead\fR is executed without
a pathname prefix and the pathname search finds a \fB/bin/head\fR or
\fB/usr/bin/head\fR executable.
.sp
.LP
\fBhead\fR copies one or more input files to standard output, stopping at a
designated point for each file or to the end of the file whichever comes
first. Copying ends at the point indicated by the options. By default, a
header of the form \fB==> filename <==\fR is output before all but the first
file but this can be changed with the \fB-q\fR and \fB-v\fR options. If no
file is given, or if the file is \fB-\fR, \fBhead\fR copies from standard
input starting at the current location.
.sp
.LP
The option argument for \fB-c\fR and \fB-s\fR can optionally be followed by
one of the following characters to specify a different unit other than a
single byte:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBb\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
512 bytes
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBk\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
1-kilobyte
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBm\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
1-megabyte
.RE

.sp
.LP
For backwards compatibility, \fB-number\fR is equivalent to \fB-n\fR
number.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "/usr/bin/head"
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported by \fB/usr/bin/head\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-n\fR \fInumber\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
The first \fInumber\fR lines of each input file is copied to standard
output. The \fInumber\fR option-argument must be a positive decimal
integer.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-\fInumber\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
The \fInumber\fR argument is a positive decimal integer with the same
effect as the \fB-n\fR \fInumber\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If no options are specified, \fBhead\fR acts as if \fB-n\fR \fB10\fR had
been specified.
.SS "ksh93"
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported by the head built-in command in
\fBksh93\fR:
.sp

.mk
.na
\fB-n\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fB--lines=\fIlines\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-v\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fB--verbose\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Always output filename headers.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIfilename\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
A path name of an input file. If no \fIfile\fR operands are specified, the
standard input is used.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBhead\fR
when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRWriting the First Ten Lines of All Files
.sp
.LP
The following example writes the first ten lines of all files, except those
with a leading period, in the directory:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBhead *\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP

variables that affect the execution of \fBhead\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR,
\fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
