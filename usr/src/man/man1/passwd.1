.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpasswd\fR command changes the password or lists password attributes
associated with the user's login \fIname\fR. Additionally, privileged users
can use \fBpasswd\fR to install or change passwords and attributes
associated with any login \fIname\fR.
.sp
.LP
When used to change a password, \fBpasswd\fR prompts everyone for their old
password, if any. It then prompts for the new password twice. When the old
password is entered, \fBpasswd\fR checks to see if it has aged sufficiently.
If \fBaging\fR is insufficient, \fBpasswd\fR terminates; see
\fBpwconv\fR(1M), \fBnistbladm\fR(1), and \fBshadow\fR(4) for additional
information.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpwconv\fR command creates and updates \fB/etc/shadow\fR with
information from \fB/etc/passwd\fR. \fBpwconv\fR relies on a special value
of \fBx\fR in the password field of \fB/etc/passwd\fR. This value of
\fBx\fRindicates that the password for the user is already in
\fB/etc/shadow\fR and should not be modified.
.sp
.LP
If aging is sufficient, a check is made to ensure that the new password
meets construction requirements. When the new password is entered a second
time, the two copies of the new password are compared. If the two copies are
not identical, the cycle of prompting for the new password is repeated for,
at most, two more times.
.sp
.LP
Passwords must be constructed to meet the following requirements:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Each password must have \fBPASSLENGTH\fR characters, where \fBPASSLENGTH\fR
is defined in \fB/etc/default/passwd\fR and is set to \fB6\fR. Setting
\fBPASSLENGTH\fR to more than eight characters requires configuring
\fBpolicy.conf\fR(4) with an algorithm that supports greater than eight
characters.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Each password must meet the configured complexity constraints specified in
\fB/etc/default/passwd\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Each password must not be a member of the configured dictionary as
specified in \fB/etc/default/passwd\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
For accounts in name services which support password history checking, if
prior password history is defined, new passwords must not be contained in
the prior password history.
.RE
.sp
.LP
If all requirements are met, by default, the \fBpasswd\fR command consults
\fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR to determine in which repositories to perform
password update. It searches the \fBpasswd\fR and \fBpasswd_compat\fR
entries. The sources (repositories) associated with these entries are
updated. However, the password update configurations supported are limited
to the following cases. Failure to comply with the configurations prevents
users from logging onto the system. The password update configurations
are:
.RS +4

.LP
You can add the \fBad\fR keyword to any of the \fBpasswd\fR configurations
in the above list. However, you cannot use the \fBpasswd\fR command to
change the password of an Active Directory (AD) user. If the \fBad\fR
keyword is found in the \fBpasswd\fR entry during a password update
operation, it is ignored. To update the password of an AD user, use the
\fBkpasswd\fR(1) command.
.sp
.LP
Network administrators, who own the NIS+ password table, can change any
password attributes. The administrator configured for updating LDAP shadow
information can also change any password attributes. See
\fBldapclient\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
When a user has a password stored in one of the name services as well as a
local \fBfiles\fR entry, the \fBpasswd\fR command updates both. It is
possible to have different passwords in the name service and local files
entry. Use \fBpasswd\fR \fB-r\fR to change a specific password repository.

.sp
.LP
In the \fBfiles\fR case, super-users (for instance, real and effective uid
equal to \fB0\fR, see \fBid\fR(1M) and \fBsu\fR(1M)) can change any
password. Hence, \fBpasswd\fR does not prompt privileged users for the old
password. Privileged users are not forced to comply with password aging and
password construction requirements. A privileged user can create a null
password by entering a carriage return in response to the prompt for a new
password. (This differs from \fBpasswd\fR \fB-d\fR because the
\fBpassword\fR prompt is still displayed.) If NIS is in effect, superuser on
the root master can change any password without being prompted for the old
NIS \fBpasswd\fR, and is not forced to comply with password construction
requirements.
.sp
.LP
If LDAP is in effect, superuser on any Native LDAP client system can change
any password without being prompted for the old LDAP passwd, and is not
forced to comply with password construction requirements.
.sp
.LP
Normally, \fBpasswd\fR entered with no arguments changes the password of
the current user. When a user logs in and then invokes \fBsu\fR(1M) to
become superuser or another user, \fBpasswd\fR changes the original user's
password, not the password of the superuser or the new user.
.sp
.LP
Any user can use the \fB-s\fR option to show password attributes for his or
her own login \fIname\fR, provided they are using the \fB-r\fR \fBnisplus\fR
argument. Otherwise, the \fB-s\fR argument is restricted to the superuser.

\fBpasswd\fR uses \fBpam\fR(3PAM) for password change. It calls PAM with a
service name \fBpasswd\fR and uses service module type \fBauth\fR for
authentication and password for password change.
.sp
.LP
Locking an account (\fB-l\fR option) does not allow its use for password
based login or delayed execution (such as \fBat\fR(1), \fBbatch\fR(1), or
\fBcron\fR(1M)). The \fB-N\fR option can be used to disallow password based
login, while continuing to allow delayed execution.
