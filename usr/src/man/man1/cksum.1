.SH NAME
cksum \- write file checksums and sizes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcksum\fR [\fIfile\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B cksum
command calculates and writes to standard output a cyclic
redundancy check (CRC) for each input file, and also writes to standard
output the number of octets in each file.
.sp
.LP
For each file processed successfully,
.B cksum
will write in the
following format:
.sp
.LP
\fB"%u %d %s\en"\fR <\fIchecksum\fR>, <\fI# of octets\fR>, <\fIpath
name\fR>
.sp
.LP
If no
.I file
operand was specified, the path name and its leading space
will be omitted.
.sp
.LP
The CRC used is based on the polynomial used for CRC error checking in the
referenced Ethernet standard.
.sp
.LP
The encoding for the CRC checksum is defined by the generating
polynomial:
.sp
.LP
\fIG\|\fR(\fIx\fR) = \fIx\fR^32 + \fIx\fR^26 + \fIx\fR^23 + \fIx\fR^22 +
\fIx\fR^16 + \fIx\fR^12 + \fIx\fR^11 + \fIx\fR^10 + \fIx\fR^8 + \fIx\fR^7 +
\fIx\fR^5 + \fIx\fR^4 + \fIx\fR^2 +
.I x
+ 1
.sp
.LP
Mathematically, the CRC value corresponding to a given file is defined by
the following procedure:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
The
.I n
bits to be evaluated are considered to be the coefficients of a
mod 2 polynomial \fIM\fR(\fIx\fR) of degree \fIn\fR\(mi\fI1.\fR These
.I n
bits are the bits from the file, with the most significant bit being
the most significant bit of the first octet of the file and the last bit
being the least significant bit of the last octet, padded with zero bits (if
necessary) to achieve an integral number of octets, followed by one or more
octets representing the length of the file as a binary value, least
significant octet first. The smallest number of octets capable of
representing this integer is used.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
\fIM\fR(\fIx\fR) is multiplied by
.I x
^\fI32\fR (that is, shifted left
.RI "32 bits) and divided by " G ( x )
using mod 2 division, producing a
remainder \fIR\fR(\fIx\fR) of degree \(<= 31.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
.RI "The coefficients of " R ( x )
are considered to be a 32-bit
sequence.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP

The bit sequence is complemented and the result is the CRC.

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I file
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt
A path name of a file to be checked. If no
.I file
operands are
specified, the standard input is used.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The
.B cksum
command is typically used to quickly compare a suspect file
against a trusted version of the same, such as to ensure that files
transmitted over noisy media arrive intact. However, this comparison cannot
be considered cryptographically secure. The chances of a damaged file
producing the same CRC as the original are astronomically small; deliberate
deception is difficult, but probably not impossible.
.sp
.LP
Although input files to
.B cksum
can be any type, the results need not
be what would be expected on character special device files. Since this
document does not specify the block size used when doing input, checksums of
character special files need not process all of the data in those files.
.sp
.LP
The algorithm is expressed in terms of a bitstream divided into octets. If
a file is transmitted between two systems and undergoes any data
transformation (such as moving 8-bit characters into 9-bit bytes or changing
"Little Endian" byte ordering to "Big Endian"), identical CRC values cannot
be expected. Implementations performing such transformations may extend
.B cksum
to handle such situations.
.sp
.LP
See
.BR largefile (5)
for the description of the behavior of
.BR cksum
when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
