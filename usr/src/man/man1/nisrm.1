.SH NAME
nisrm \- remove NIS+ objects from the namespace
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBnisrm\fR [\fB-if\fR] \fIname\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnisrm\fR command removes NIS+ objects named \fIname\fR from the
NIS+ namespace.
.sp
.LP
This command will fail if the NIS+ master server is not running.
.sp
.LP
This command will not remove directories. See \fBnisrmdir\fR(1). Nor will
it remove non-empty tables. See \fBnistbladm\fR(1).
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-i\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Interactive mode. Like the system  \fBrm\fR(1) command the \fBnisrm\fR
command will ask for confirmation prior to removing an object. If the name
specified by \fIname\fR is a non-fully qualified name this option is forced
on. This prevents the removal of unexpected objects.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-f\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Force. The removal is attempted, and if it fails for permission reasons, a
\fBnischmod\fR(1) is attempted and the removal retried. If the command
fails, it fails silently.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
