.SH NAME
postreverse \- reverse the page order in a PostScript file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBpostreverse\fR [\fB-o\fR \fIlist\fR] [\fB-r\fR] [\fIfile\fR]
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/lp/postscript/postreverse\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B postreverse
filter reverses the page order in files that conform
to Adobe's Version 1.0 or Version 2.0 file structuring conventions, and
writes the results on the standard output. Only one input \fBfile\fR is
allowed and if no \fBfile\fR is specified, the standard input is read.
.sp
.LP
The
.B postreverse
filter can handle a limited class of files that
violate page independence, provided all global definitions are bracketed by
\fB%%BeginGlobal\fR and \fB%%EndGlobal\fR comments. In addition, files that
mark the end of each page with
.B "%%EndPage: label ordinal"
comments will
also reverse properly, provided the prologue and trailer sections can be
located. If
.B postreverse
fails to find an
.B %%EndProlog
or
\fB%%EndSetup\fR comment, the entire \fBfile\fR is copied, unmodified, to
the standard output.
.sp
.LP
Because global definitions are extracted from individual pages and put in
the prologue, the output file can be minimally conforming, even if the input
\fBfile\fR was not.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.BI -o " list"
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Select pages whose numbers are given in the comma-separated
.IR list .
The
\fIlist\fR contains single numbers \fIN\fR and ranges \fIN1\fR \(mi
.IR N2 .
A missing
.I N1
means the lowest numbered page, a missing
\fIN2\fR means the highest. The page range is an expression of logical pages
rather than physical sheets of paper. For example, if you are printing two
logical pages to a sheet, and you specified a range of
.BR 4 ,
then two
sheets of paper would print, containing four page layouts. If you specified
a page range of
.BR 3-4 ,
when requesting two logical pages to a sheet;
then
.I only
page 3 and page 4 layouts would print, and they would appear
on one physical sheet of paper.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1\fR Examples of \fBpostreverse\fR.
.sp
.LP
o select pages 1 to 100 from \fBfile\fR and reverse the pages:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBexample% postreverse \fB-o1\fB\(mi100 \fBfile\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
To print four logical pages on each physical page and reverse all the
pages:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBexample% postprint \fB-n4\fB \fBfile\fR | postreverse
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
To produce a minimally conforming file from output generated by
.BR dpost
without reversing the pages:

.in +2
.nf
\fBexample% dpost \fBfile\fR | postreverse \fB-r\fR
.fi
.in -2

.LP
No attempt has been made to deal with redefinitions of global variables or
procedures. If standard input is used, the input \fBfile\fR will be read
three times before being reversed.
