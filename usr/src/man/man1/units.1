.SH NAME
units \- converts quantities expressed in standard scales to other scales
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBunits\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBunits\fR converts quantities expressed in various standard scales to
their equivalents in other scales. It works interactively in this fashion:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
You have:~~\fBinch\fR
You want:~~\fBcm\fR
        * 2.540000e+00
/ 3.937008e\(mi01
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
A quantity is specified as a multiplicative combination of units optionally
preceded by a numeric multiplier. Powers are indicated by suffixed positive
integers, division by the usual sign:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
You have:~~\fB15 lbs force/in2\fR
You want:~~\fBatm\fR
        * 1.020689e+00
        / 9.797299e\(mi01
.fi
.in -2

\fBunits\fR only does multiplicative scale changes; thus it can convert
Kelvin to Rankine, but not Celsius to Fahrenheit. Most familiar units,
abbreviations, and metric prefixes are recognized, together with a generous
leavening of exotica and a few constants of nature including:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B pi
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
ratio of circumference to diameter,
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fBPound\fR is not recognized as a unit of mass; \fBlb\fR is. Compound
names are run together, (for example,
.BR lightyear ).
British units that
differ from their U.S. counterparts are prefixed thus:
.BR brgallon .
