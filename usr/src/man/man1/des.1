.SH NAME
des \- encrypt or decrypt data using Data Encryption Standard
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdes\fR encrypts and decrypts data using the \fBNBS\fR Data Encryption
Standard algorithm. One of  \fB-e\fR (for encrypt) or \fB-d\fR (for decrypt) must
be specified.
.sp
.LP
The  \fBdes\fR command is provided to promote secure exchange of data in a
standard fashion.
.sp
.LP
Two standard encryption modes are supported by the \fBdes\fR program, Cipher
Block Chaining (CBC \(em the default) and Electronic Code Book (ECB \(em
specified with \fB-b\fR). \fBCBC\fR mode treats an entire file as a unit of
encryption, that is, if insertions or deletions are made to the encrypted file
then decryption will not succeed. \fBCBC\fR mode also ensures that regularities
in clear data do not appear in the encrypted data. \fBECB\fR mode treats each 8
bytes as units of encryptions, so if parts of the encrypted file are modified
then other parts may still be decrypted. Identical values of clear text encrypt
to identical values of cipher text.
.sp
.LP
The key used for the \fBDES\fR algorithm is obtained by prompting the user
unless the `\fB-k\fR \fIkey\fR' option is given. If the key is an argument to the
\fBdes\fR command, it is potentially visible to users executing \fBps\fR(1) or a
derivative. To minimize this possibility, \fBdes\fR takes care to destroy the key
argument immediately upon entry.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdes\fR command attempts to use \fBDES\fR hardware for its job, but will
use a software implementation of the \fBDES\fR algorithm if the hardware is
unavailable. Normally, a warning message is printed if the \fBDES\fR hardware is
unavailable since the software is only about 1/50th as fast.  However, the
\fB-f\fR option will suppress the warning. The \fB-s\fR option may be used to
force use of software instead of hardware \fBDES.\fR
.sp
.LP
The \fBdes\fR command reads from standard input unless \fIinput-file\fR is
specified and writes to standard output unless \fIoutput-file\fR is given.
.sp
.LP
The following sections give information required to implement compatible
facilities in other environments.
.sp
.LP
Since the \fBCBC\fR and \fBECB\fR modes of \fBDES\fR require units of 8 bytes to
be encrypted, files being encrypted by the \fBdes\fR command have 1 to 8 bytes
appended to them to cause them to be a multiple of 8 bytes. The last byte, when
decrypted, gives the number of bytes (0 to 7) which are to be saved of the last 8
bytes. The other bytes of those appended to the input are randomized before
encryption. If, when decrypting, the last byte is not in the range of 0 to 7 then
either the encrypted file has been corrupted or an incorrect key was provided for
decryption and an error message is printed.
.sp
.LP
The \fBDES\fR algorithm requires an 8 byte key whose low order bits are assumed
to be odd-parity bits.  The \fBASCII\fR key supplied by the user is zero padded
to 8 bytes and the high order bits are set to be odd-parity bits.  The \fBDES\fR
algorithm then ignores the low bit of each \fBASCII\fR character, but that bit's
information has been preserved in the high bit due to the parity.
.sp
.LP
The \fBCBC\fR mode of operation always uses an initial value of all zeros for
the initialization vector, so the first 8 bytes of a file are encrypted the same
whether in \fBCBC\fR or \fBECB\fR mode.

.SH BUGS
.sp
.LP
It would be better to use a real 56-bit key rather than an ASCII-based 56-bit
pattern. Knowing that the key was derived from \fBASCII\fR radically reduces the
time necessary for a brute-force cryptographic attack.
