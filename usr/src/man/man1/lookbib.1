.SH NAME
lookbib \- find references in a bibliographic database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBlookbib\fR \fIdatabase\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
A bibliographic reference is a set of lines, constituting fields of
bibliographic information.  Each field starts on a line beginning with a
`\fB%\fR', followed by a key-letter, then a blank, and finally the contents
of the field, which may continue until the next line starting with
`\fB%\fR'.
.sp
.LP
The
.B lookbib
utility uses an inverted index made by
.B indxbib
to
find sets of bibliographic references.  It reads keywords typed after the
`\fB>\fR' prompt on the terminal, and retrieves records containing all these
keywords. If nothing matches, nothing is returned except another `\fB>\fR'
prompt.
.sp
.LP
It is possible to search multiple databases, as long as they have a common
index made by
.BR indxbib (1).
In that case, only the first argument given
to
.B indxbib
is specified to
.BR lookbib .
.sp
.LP
If \fBlookbib\fR does not find the index files (the \fB\&.i\fR[\fBabc\fR]
files), it looks for a reference file with the same name as the argument,
without the suffixes.  It creates a file with a \fB\&.ig\fR suffix, suitable
for use with \fBfgrep\fR (see
.BR grep (1)).
\fBlookbib\fR then uses this
\fBfgrep\fR file to find references.  This method is simpler to use, but the
\fB\&.ig\fR file is slower to use than the \fB\&.i\fR[\fBabc\fR] files, and
does not allow the use of multiple reference files.

Probably all dates should be indexed, since many disciplines refer to
literature written in the 1800s or earlier.
