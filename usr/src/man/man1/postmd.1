.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpostmd\fR filter reads a series of floating point numbers from
\fIfile\fRs, translates them into a PostScript gray scale image, and writes
the results on the standard output. In a typical application, the numbers
might be the elements of a large matrix, written in row major order, while
the printed image could help locate patterns in the matrix. If no
\fIfile\fRs are specified, or if \fB-\fR is one of the input \fIfile\fRs,
the standard input is read.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-b\fR \fInum\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Packs the bitmap in the output file using \fInum\fR byte patterns. A value
of \fB0\fR turns off all packing of the output file. By default, \fInum\fR
is \fB6\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-c\fR \fInum\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Prints \fInum\fR copies of each page. By default, only one copy is
printed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-d\fR \fIdimen\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Sets the default matrix dimensions for all input \fIfile\fRs to
\fIdimen\fR. The \fIdimen\fR string can be given as \fIrows\fR or
\fIrows\fBx\fR \fIcolumns\fR. If \fIcolumns\fR is omitted it will be set
to rows. By default, \fBpostmd\fR assumes each matrix is square and sets the
number of rows and columns to the square root of the number of elements in
each input file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-g\fR \fIlist\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
\fIlist\fR is a comma- or space-separated string of integers, each lying
between 0 and 255 inclusive, that assigns PostScript gray scales to the
regions of the real line selected by the \fB-i\fR option. 255 corresponds to
white, and 0, to black. The \fBpostmd\fR filter assigns a default gray scale
that omits white (that is, 255)  and gets darker as the regions move from
left to right along the real line.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-i\fR \fIlist\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
\fIlist\fR is a comma-, space-, or slash(\fB/\fR)-separated string of
\fIN\fR floating point numbers that partition the real line into 2\fIN\fR+1
regions. The \fIlist\fR must be given in increasing numerical order. The
partitions are used  to map floating point numbers read from the input
\fIfile\fRs into gray scale integers that are either assigned automatically
by \fBpostmd\fR or arbitrarily selected using the \fB-g\fR option. The
default interval \fIlist\fR is \fB-1,0,1\fR, which partions the real line
into seven regions.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-m\fR \fInum\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Magnifies each logical page by the factor \fInum\fR. Pages are scaled
uniformly about the origin which, by default, is located at the center of
each page. The default magnification is \fB1.0\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-n\fR \fInum\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Prints \fInum\fR logical pages on each piece of paper, where \fInum\fR can
be any positive integer. By default, \fInum\fR is set to  \fB1\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-o\fR \fIlist\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Prints pages whose numbers are given in the comma separated \fIlist\fR. The
list contains single numbers \fIN\fR and ranges \fIN1 \fR- \fIN2\fR. A
missing \fIN1\fR means the lowest numbered page, a missing \fIN2\fR means
the highest. The page range is an expression of logical pages rather than
physical sheets of paper. For example, if you are printing two logical pages
to a sheet, and you specified a range of \fB4\fR, then two sheets of paper
would print, containing four page layouts. If you specified a page range of
\fB3-4\fR, when requesting two logical pages to a sheet; then \fIonly\fR
page 3 and page 4 layouts would print, and they would appear on one physical
sheet of paper.

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-p\fR \fImode\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Prints \fIfile\fRs in either portrait or landscape \fImode\fR. Only the
first character of \fImode\fR is significant. The default \fImode\fR is
portrait.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-w\fR \fIwindow\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
\fIwindow\fR is a comma- or space-separated list of four positive integers
that select the upper left and lower right corners of a submatrix from each
of the input \fIfiles\fR. Row and column indices start at \fB1\fR in the
upper left corner and the numbers in the input \fIfile\fRs are assumed to be
written in row major order. By default, the entire matrix is displayed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-x\fR \fInum\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Translates the origin \fInum\fR inches along the positive x axis. The
default coordinate system has the origin fixed at the center of the page,
with positive x to the right and positive y up the page. Positive \fInum\fR
moves everything right. The default offset is  \fB0\fR inches.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-y\fR \fI num\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Translates the origin \fInum\fR inches along the positive y axis. Positive
\fInum\fR moves everything up the page. The default offset is  \fB0\fR.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Only one matrix is displayed on each logical page, and each of the input
\fIfile\fRs must contain complete descriptions of exactly one matrix. Matrix
elements are floating point numbers  arranged in row major order in each
input file. White space, including newlines,  is not used to determine
matrix dimensions. By default, \fBpostmd\fR assumes each matrix is square
and sets the number of rows and columns to the square root of the number of
elements in the input file. Supplying default dimensions on the command line
with the \fB-d\fR option overrides this default behavior, and in that case
the dimensions apply to all input \fIfile\fRs.
.sp
.LP
An optional header can be supplied with each input file and is used to set
the matrix dimensions,  the partition of the real line,  the gray scale map,
and a window into the matrix. The header consists of keyword/value pairs,
each on a separate line. It begins on the first line of each input file and
ends with the first unrecognized string, which should be the first matrix
element. Values set in the header take precedence,  but apply only to the
current input file. Recognized header keywords are \fBdimension\fR,
\fBinterval\fR, \fBgrayscale\fR, and \fBwindow\fR. The syntax of the value
string that follows each keyword  parallels what is accepted by the
\fB-d\fR, \fB-i\fR, \fB-g\fR, and \fB-w\fR options.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRGenerating an interval list
.sp
.LP
For example, suppose \fIfile\fR initially contains the 1000 numbers in a
20x50 matrix. Then you can produce exactly the same output by completing
three steps.

.RS +4
.TP
1.
First, issue the following command line:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBpostmd -d20x50 -i"-100 100" -g0,128,254,128,0 file\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE

2.
Second, prepend the following header to \fBfile\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBpostmd -d20x50 -i"\(mi100 100" -g0,128,254,128,0 file\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE

Third, issue the following command line:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBpostmd file\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE
.sp
.LP
The interval list partitions the real line into five regions and the gray
scale list maps numbers less than -100 or greater than 100 into 0 (that is,
black), numbers equal to -100 or 100 into 128 (that is, 50 percent black),
and numbers between -100 and 100 into 254 (that is, almost white).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The largest matrix that can be adequately displayed is a function of the
interval and gray scale lists, the printer resolution, and the paper size. A
600 by 600 matrix is an optimistic upper bound for a two element interval
list (that is, five regions) using 8.5 by 11 inch paper on a 300 dpi
printer.
.sp
.LP
Using white (that is, 255) in a gray scale list  is not recommended and
won't show up in  the legend and bar graph that \fBpostmd\fR displays below
each image.
