.SH NAME
let \- shell built-in function to evaluate one or more arithmetic
expressions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS "ksh"
.LP
.nf
\fBlet\fR \fIarg\fR...
.fi

.SS "ksh93"
.LP
.nf
\fBlet\fR [\fIexpr\fR...]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "ksh"
.sp
.LP
Each \fIarg\fR is a separate arithmetic expression to be evaluated.
.SS "ksh93"
.sp
.LP
\fBlet\fR evaluates each \fIexpr\fR in the current shell environment as an
arithmetic expression using ANSI C syntax. Variables names are shell
variables and they are recursively evaluated as arithmetic expressions to
get numerical values. \fBlet\fR has been made obsolete by the \fB((...))\fR
syntax of \fBksh93\fR(1) which does not require quoting of the operators to
pass them as command arguments.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.SS "ksh"
.sp
.LP
\fBksh\fR returns the following exit values:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
The value of the last expression is \fBnon-zero\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB1\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
The value of the last expression is zero.
.RE

.SS "ksh93"
.sp
.LP
\fBksh93\fR returns the following exit values:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
The last \fIexpr\fR evaluates to a \fBnon-zero\fR value.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB>0\fR\fR
.ad
