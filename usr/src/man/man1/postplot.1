.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpostplot\fR filter translates \fBplot\fR(1B) graphics
\fIfilenames\fR into PostScript and writes the results on the standard
output. If no \fIfilenames\fR are specified, or if \fB\(mi\fR is one of the
input \fIfilenames\fR, the standard input is read.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-c\fI num\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Print \fInum\fR copies of each page. By default, only one copy is
printed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-f\fI name\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Print text using font \fIname\fR. Any PostScript font can be used, although
the best results will be obtained  only with constant width fonts. The
default font is Courier.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-m\fI num\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Magnify each logical page by the factor \fInum\fR. Pages are scaled
uniformly about the origin which, by default, is located at the center of
each page. The default magnification is 1.0.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-n\fI num\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Print \fInum\fR logical pages on each piece of paper, where \fInum\fR can
be any positive integer. By default, \fInum\fR is set to 1.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-o\fI list\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Print pages whose numbers are given in the comma-separated \fIlist\fR. The
list contains single numbers \fIN\fR and ranges \fIN1 \fR\(mi\fI N2\fR. A
missing \fIN1\fR means the lowest numbered page, a missing \fIN2\fR means
the highest.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-p\fI mode\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Print \fIfilenames\fR in either portrait or landscape \fImode\fR. Only the
first character of \fImode\fR is significant. The default \fImode\fR is
landscape.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-w\fI num\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Set the line width used for graphics to \fInum\fR points, where a point is
approximately 1/72 of an inch. By default, \fInum\fR is set to 0 points,
which forces lines to be one pixel wide.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-x\fI num\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Translate the origin \fInum\fR inches along the positive x axis. The
default coordinate system has the origin fixed at the center of the page,
with positive x to the right and positive y up the page. Positive \fInum\fR
moves everything right. The default offset is 0.0 inches.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-y\fI num\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Translate the origin \fInum\fR inches along the positive y axis. Positive
\fInum\fR moves everything up the page. The default offset is 0.0.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIfilename\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
The graphics filename to be translated
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS

the one used by the PS-2400.
