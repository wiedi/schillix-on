\fBwhatis\fR \fIcommand\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBwhatis\fR looks up a given \fIcommand\fR and displays the header line
from the manual section. You can then run the \fBman\fR(1) command to get
more information. If the line starts \fBname(\fIsection\fR)\fR.\|.\|. you
can do \fBman\fR \fB-s\fR\fB\fIsection\fR name\fR to get the documentation
for it.  Try \fBwhatis ed\fR and then you should do \fBman\fR \fB-s\fR \fB1
ed\fR to get the manual page for \fBed\fR(1).
.sp
.LP
\fBwhatis\fR is actually just the \fB-f\fR option to the \fBman\fR(1)
command.
.sp
.LP
\fBwhatis\fR uses the \fB/usr/share/man/windex\fR database.  This database
is created by \fBcatman\fR(1M). If this database does not exist,
\fBwhatis\fR will fail.
