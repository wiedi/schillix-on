.SH NAME
enable, disable \- enable/disable LP printers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/enable\fR \fIprinter\fR...
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/disable\fR [\fB-c\fR | \fB-W\fR] [\fB-r\fR [\fIreason\fR]] \fIprinter\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBenable\fR command activates printers, enabling them to print
requests submitted by the \fBlp\fR command. \fBenable\fR must be run on the
printer server.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdisable\fR command deactivates printers, disabling them from
printing requests submitted by the \fBlp\fR command. By default, any
requests that are currently printing on \fIprinter\fR are reprinted in their
entirety either on \fIprinter\fR or another member of the same class of
printers. The \fBdisable\fR command must be run on the print server.
.sp
.LP
Use \fBlpstat\fR \fB-p\fR to check the status of printers.
.sp
.LP
Generally, \fBenable\fR and \fBdisable\fR are run on the print server to
control local print queues. Under some configurations, they can also be run
on client systems when IPP is being used to communicate between client and
server.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported for use with \fBdisable\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-c\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Cancels any requests that are currently printing on \fIprinter\fR. This
option cannot be used with the \fB-W\fR option. If the printer is remote,
the \fB-c\fR option is silently ignored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-W\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Waits until the request currently being printed is finished before
disabling \fIprinter\fR. This option cannot be used with the \fB-c\fR
option. If the printer is remote, the \fB-W\fR option is silently ignored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-r\fR [\fIreason\fR]\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Assigns a \fIreason\fR for the disabling of the printer(s). This
\fIreason\fR applies to all printers specified. This \fIreason\fR is
reported by \fBlpstat\fR \fB-p\fR. Enclose \fIreason\fR in quotes if it
contains blanks. The default reason is \fBunknown reason\fR for the existing
printer, and \fB"new printer"\fR for a printer added to the system but not
yet enabled.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported for both \fBenable\fR and
\fBdisable\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIprinter\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
The name of the printer to be enabled or disabled. Specify \fIprinter\fR
using atomic or URI-style (\fIscheme\fB://\fIendpoint\fR) names. See
\fBprinters.conf\fR(4) regarding the naming conventions for destinations.
