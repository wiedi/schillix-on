.SH NAME
nischown \- change the owner of a NIS+ object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBnischown\fR [\fB-AfLP\fR] \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBnischown\fR changes the owner of the NIS+ objects or entries specified
by
.I name
to
.IR owner .
Entries are specified using indexed names (see
.BR nismatch (1)).
If
.I owner
is not a fully qualified NIS+ principal
name (see \fBnisaddcred\fR(1M)), the default domain (see
\fBnisdefaults\fR(1)) will be appended to it.
.sp
.LP
The only restriction on changing an object's owner is that you must have
modify permissions for the object. Note: If you are the current owner of an
object and you change ownership,  you may not be able to regain ownership
unless you have modify access to  the new object.
.sp
.LP
The command will fail if the master
.B NIS+
server is not running.
.sp
.LP
The
.B NIS+
server will check the validity of the name before making
the modification.
