.SH NAME
nischown \- change the owner of a NIS+ object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBnischown\fR [\fB-AfLP\fR] \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBnischown\fR changes the owner of the NIS+ objects or entries specified
by \fIname\fR to \fIowner\fR. Entries are specified using indexed names (see
\fBnismatch\fR(1)). If \fIowner\fR is not a fully qualified  NIS+ principal
name (see \fBnisaddcred\fR(1M)), the default domain (see
\fBnisdefaults\fR(1)) will be appended to it.
.sp
.LP
The only restriction on changing an object's owner is that you must have
modify permissions for the object. Note: If you are the current owner of an
object and you change ownership,  you may not be able to regain ownership
unless you have modify access to  the new object.
.sp
.LP
The command will fail if the master \fBNIS+\fR server is not running.
.sp
.LP
The  \fBNIS+\fR server will check the validity of the name before making
the modification.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-A\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Modify all entries in all tables in the concatenation path that match the
search criteria specified in \fIname.\fR It implies the \fB-P\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-f\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Force the operation and fail silently if it does not succeed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-L\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Follow links and change the owner of the linked object or entries rather
than the owner of the link itself.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-P\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Follow the concatenation path within a named table. This option is only
meaningful when either \fIname\fR is an indexed name or the \fB-L\fR option
is also specified and the named object is a link pointing to entries.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUsing the \fBnischown\fR Command
.sp
.LP
The following two examples show how to change the owner of an object to a
principal in a different domain, and to change it to a principal in the
local domain, respectively.

.sp
.in +2

.LP
The next example shows how to change the owner of an entry in the passwd
table.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
