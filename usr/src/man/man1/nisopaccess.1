.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Most NIS+ operations have implied access control through the permissions on
the objects that they manipulate. For example,  in order to read an entry in
a table, you must have read permission on that entry. However, some NIS+
operations by default perform no access checking at all and are allowed to
all:

.sp
.LP
The \fBnisopaccess\fR command can be used to enforce access control on
these operations on a per NIS+ directory basis.
.sp
.LP
The \fIdirectory\fR argument should be the fully qualified name, including
the trailing dot, of the NIS+ directory to which \fBnisopaccess\fR will be
applied. As a short-hand method, if the directory name does not end in a
trailing dot, for example "\fBorg_dir\fR", then the domain name is appended.
The domain name is also appended to partial paths such as
"\fBorg_dir.xyz\fR".
.sp
.LP
You can use upper or lower case for the \fIoperation\fR argument. However,
you cannot mix cases. The "\fBNIS_\fR"  prefix may be omitted. For example,
\fBNIS_PING\fR can be specified as  \fBNIS_PING\fR, \fBnis_ping\fR,
\fBPING\fR, or \fBping\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fIrights\fR argument is specified in the format defined by the
\fBnischmod\fR(1) command. Since only the read ("r") rights are used to
determine who has the right to perform the operation,  the modify and delete
rights may be used to control who can change  access to the operation.
.sp
.LP
The access checking performed for each operation is as  follows. When an
operation requires  access be checked on all  directories served by its
\fBrpc.nisd\fR(1M), access is denied if even one of the directories
prohibits the operation.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_CHECKPOINT\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Check specified directory, or all directories if there is no directory
argument, as is the case when \fBNIS_CHECKPOINT\fR is issued by the
"\fBnisping\fR \fB-Ca\fR" command. Return \fBNIS_PERMISSION\fR when access
is denied.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_CPTIME\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Check specified directory. It returns \fB0\fR when access  is denied.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_MKDIR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Check parent of specified directory. Returns  \fBNIS_PERMISSION\fR when
access is denied.
.sp
If the parent directory is not available locally, that is, it is not served
by this \fBrpc.nisd\fR(1M), \fBNIS_MKDIR\fR access  is allowed, though the
operation will be executed only if this \fBrpc.nisd\fR is a known replica of
the directory.
.sp
You should note that the \fBNIS_MKDIR\fR operation does not create  a NIS+
directory; it adds a directory to the serving list for this \fBrpc.nisd\fR,
if appropriate.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_PING\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Check specified directory. No return value.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_RMDIR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Check specified directory. \fBNIS_PERMISSION\fR is returned when access
denied. 
.sp
The \fBNIS_RMDIR\fR operation does not remove a NIS+ directory; it deletes
the directory from the serving list for this \fBrpc.nisd\fR, if
appropriate.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_SERVSTATE\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Check access on all directories served by this \fBrpc.nisd\fR. If access is
denied for a tag, "\fB<permission denied>\fR" is returned instead of the tag
value.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_STATUS\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Same as for \fBNIS_SERVSTATE\fR.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Notice that older clients may not supply authentication information for
some of the operations listed above. These clients are treated as "nobody"
when access checking is performed.
.sp
.LP
The access control is implemented by creating a NIS+ table  called
"\fBproto_op_access\fR" in each NIS+ directory to which  access control
should be applied. The table can be manipulated using normal NIS+ commands.
However, \fBnisopaccess\fR is the only supported interface for NIS+
operation access control.

.sp
.LP
To enable access control for the \fBNIS_PING\fR operation on
"\fBorg_dir.`domainname`.\fR" such that only the owner of the directory can
perform a \fBNIS_PING\fR, or change the \fBNIS_PING\fR rights:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBnisopaccess org_dir NIS_PING o=rmcd,g=,w=,n=\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRListing the Access to \fBNIS_PING\fR
.sp
.LP

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBnisopaccess -l org_dir NIS_PING\fR

NIS_PING    ----rmcd--------    owner.dom.ain.  group.dom.ain.

\fBExample 3 \fRRemoving Access Control for \fBNIS_PING\fR

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBnisopaccess -r org_dir NIS_PING\fR

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating
system. Tools to aid the migration from NIS+ to LDAP are available in the
current Solaris release. For more information, visit
