.SH NAME
t_sndvudata \- send a data unit from one or more noncontiguous buffers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>




\fBint\fR \fBt_sndvudata\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBstruct t_unitdata *\fIunitdata\fR, \fBstruct t_iovec  *\fIiov\fR,
     \fBunsigned int\fR \fIiovcount\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This function is used in connectionless mode to send a data unit to another
transport user.  The argument  \fIfd\fR identifies the local transport endpoint
through which data will be sent, 
.I iovcount
contains the number of
non-contiguous
.I udata
buffers and is limited to an implementation-defined
value given by 
.B T_IOV_MAX
.RI "which is at least 16, and " " unitdata"
points to a 
.B t_unitdata
structure containing the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
struct netbuf addr;
struct netbuf opt;
struct netbuf udata;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
If the limit on 
.I iovcount
is exceeded, the function fails with
.BR TBADDATA .
.sp
.LP
In
.BR unitdata ,
\fIaddr\fR specifies the protocol address of the
destination user, and 
.I opt
identifies options that the user wants
associated with this request. The 
.I udata
field is not used.  The user may
choose not to specify what protocol options are associated with the transfer by
setting the 
.I len
field of 
.I opt
to zero.  In this case, the provider
may use default options.
.sp
.LP
The data to be sent is identified by  \fIiov\fB[0]\fR through \fIiov
[iovcount-1]\fB\&.\fR 
.sp
.LP
Note that the limit on the total number of bytes available in all buffers
passed:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIiov(0).iov_len + . . + iov(iovcount-1).iov_len \fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
may be constrained by implementation limits. If no other constraint applies,
it will be limited by
.BR INT_MAX .
In practice, the availability of memory to
an application is likely to impose a lower limit on the amount of data that can
be sent or received using scatter/gather functions.
.sp
.LP
By default, 
.B t_sndvudata()
operates in synchronous mode and may wait if
flow control restrictions prevent the data from being accepted by the local
transport provider at the time the call is made.  However, if  \fBO_NONBLOCK\fR
is set by means of 
.BR t_open "(3NSL) or "
.BR fcntl (2),
.B t_sndvudata()
executes in asynchronous mode and will fail under such conditions.  The process
can arrange to be notified of the clearance of a flow control restriction by
means of either  \fBt_look\fR(3NSL) or the EM interface.
.sp
.LP
If the amount of data specified in  \fIiov\fB0\fR through \fIiov
[iovcount-1]\fR exceeds the TSDU size as returned in the  \fItsdu\fR field of
the \fIinfo\fR argument of \fBt_open\fR(3NSL) or  \fBt_getinfo\fR(3NSL), or is
zero and sending of zero octets is not supported by the underlying transport
service, a
.B TBADDATA
error is generated.  If 
.B t_sndvudata()
is
called before the destination user has activated its transport endpoint (see
\fBt_bind\fR(3NSL)\|), the data unit may be discarded.
.sp
.LP
If it is not possible for the transport provider to immediately detect the
conditions that cause the errors
.B TBADDADDR
and
.BR TBADOPT ,
these
errors will alternatively be returned by 
.BR t_rcvuderr "(3NSL). An"
application must therefore be prepared to receive these errors in both of these
ways.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of 
.B 0
is returned. Otherwise, a
value of  -1 is returned and 
.B t_errno
is set to indicate an error.
