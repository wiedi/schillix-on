.SH NAME
t_sysconf \- get configurable XTI variables
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
#include <xti.h>



\fBint\fR \fBt_sysconf\fR(\fBint\fIname\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The  \fBt_sysconf()\fR function provides a method for the application to
determine the current value of configurable and implementation-dependent
XTI limits or options.
.sp
.LP
The
.I name
argument represents the XTI system variable to be queried.
The following table lists the minimal set of XTI system variables from
\fB<xti.h>\fR that can be returned by
.BR t_sysconf() ,
and the symbolic
constants, defined in
.B <xti.h>
that are the corresponding values used
for
.IR name .

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If
.I name
is valid,  \fBt_sysconf()\fR returns the value of the
.RB "requested limit/option, which might be  -1, and leaves " " t_errno"
unchanged. Otherwise, a value of  -1 is returned and
.B t_errno
is set
to indicate an error.
