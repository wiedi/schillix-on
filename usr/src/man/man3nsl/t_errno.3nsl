.TH t_errno 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_errno \- XTI error return value
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This error return value is part of the XTI interfaces that evolved from the
TLI interfaces. XTI represents the future evolution of these interfaces.
However, TLI interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a TLI
interface that has the same name as an XTI interfaces, a different
headerfile, <\fBtiuser.h\fR>, must be used. Refer the the TLI COMPATIBILITY
section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
.B t_errno
is used by XTI functions to return error values.
.sp
.LP
XTI functions provide an error number in
.B t_errno
which has type
.I int
and is defined in
.BR <xti.h> \&.
The value of
.BR t_errno
will be defined only after a call to a XTI function for which it is
explicitly stated to be set and until it is changed by the next XTI function
call. The value of
.B t_errno
should only be examined when it is
indicated to be valid by a function's return value. Programs should obtain
the definition of
.B t_errno
by the inclusion of
.BR <xti.h> \&.
The
practice of defining
.B t_errno
in program as
.BR "extern int"
.B t_errno
is obsolescent. No XTI function sets
.B t_errno
to 0 to
indicate an error.
.sp
.LP
It is unspecified whether
.B t_errno
is a macro or an identifier with
external linkage.  It represents a modifiable
.B lvalue
of type
.IR int .
If a macro definition is suppressed in order to access an actual
object or a program defines an identifier with name
.IR t_errno ,
the
behavior is undefined.
.sp
.LP
The symbolic values stored in
.B t_errno
by an XTI function are defined
in the
.B ERRORS
sections in all relevant XTI function definition
pages.
.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
.B t_errno
is also used by TLI functions to return error values.
.sp
.LP
The
.B XTI
and
.B TLI
interface definitions have common names but use
different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two
interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The
.B XTI
interfaces use the header file, <\fBxti.h\fR>. \fBTLI\fR
interfaces should
.I not
use this header.  They should use the header:
.br
.in +2
.B #include <tiuser.h>
.in -2
.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The
.B t_errno
values that can be set by the
.B XTI
interface but
cannot be set by the
.B TLI
interface are:
.br

.B TNOSTRUCTYPE
