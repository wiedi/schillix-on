.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The NIS+ namespace functions are used to locate and manipulate all NIS+
objects except the NIS+ entry objects.  See \fBnis_objects\fR(3NSL). To look
up the NIS+ entry objects within a \fBNIS+\fR table, refer to
\fBnis_subr\fR(3NSL).
.sp
.LP
\fBnis_lookup()\fR resolves a NIS+ name and returns a copy of that object
from a NIS+ server. \fBnis_add()\fR and \fBnis_remove()\fR add and remove
objects to the NIS+ namespace, respectively. \fBnis_modify()\fR can change
specific attributes of an object that already exists in the namespace.
.sp
.LP
These functions should be used only with names that refer to an NIS+
Directory, NIS+ Table, NIS+ Group, or NIS+ Private object. If a name refers to
an NIS+ entry object, the functions listed in \fBnis_subr\fR(3NSL) should be
used.
.sp
.LP
\fBnis_freeresult()\fR frees all memory associated with a \fBnis_result\fR
structure. This function must be called to free the memory associated with a
NIS+ result. \fBnis_lookup()\fR, \fBnis_add()\fR, \fBnis_remove()\fR, and
\fBnis_modify()\fR all return a pointer to a  \fBnis_result()\fR structure
which must be freed by calling \fBnis_freeresult()\fR when you have finished
using it. If one or more of the objects returned in the structure need to be
retained, they can be copied with \fBnis_clone_object\fR(3NSL). See
\fBnis_subr\fR(3NSL).
.sp
.LP
\fBnis_lookup()\fR takes two parameters, the name of the object to be
resolved in \fIname\fR, and a flags parameter,  \fIflags\fR, which is defined
below. The object name is expected to correspond to the syntax of a
non-indexed NIS+ name . See \fBnis_tables\fR(3NSL). The \fBnis_lookup()\fR
function is the only function from this group that can use a non-fully
qualified name. If the parameter  \fIname\fR is not a fully qualified name,
then the flag \fBEXPAND_NAME\fR must be specified in the call.  If this flag
is not specified, the function will fail with the error \fBNIS_BADNAME\fR.
.sp
.LP
The  \fIflags\fR parameter is constructed by logically ORing zero or more
flags from the following list.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBFOLLOW_LINKS\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
When specified, the client library will ``follow'' links by issuing another
NIS+ lookup call for the object named by the link. If the linked object is
itself a link, then this process will iterate until the either a object is
found that is not a \fBLINK\fR type object, or the library has followed 16
links.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBHARD_LOOKUP\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
When specified, the client library will retry the lookup until it is answered
by a server. Using this flag will cause the library to block until at least
one NIS+ server is available. If the network connectivity is impaired,  this
can be a relatively long time.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNO_CACHE\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
When specified, the client library will bypass any object  caches and will
get the object from either the master  NIS+ server or one of its replicas.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBMASTER_ONLY\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
When specified, the client library will bypass any object  caches and any
domain replicas and fetch the object from the  NIS+ master server for the
object's domain. This insures that the object returned is up to date at the
cost of a possible performance degradation and failure if the master server is
unavailable or physically distant.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEXPAND_NAME\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
When specified, the client library will attempt to expand a partially
qualified name by calling the function \fBnis_getnames()\fR, which uses the
environment variable \fBNIS_PATH\fR. See \fBnis_subr\fR(3NSL).
.RE

.sp
.LP
The status value may be translated to ASCII text using the function
\fBnis_sperrno()\fR. See \fBnis_error\fR(3NSL).
.sp
.LP
On return, the \fIobjects\fR array in the result will contain one and
possibly several objects that were resolved by the request. If the
\fBFOLLOW_LINKS\fR flag was present, on success the function could return
several entry objects if the link in question pointed within a table. If an
error occurred when following a link, the objects array will contain a copy of
the link object itself.
.sp
.LP
The function \fBnis_add()\fR will take the object  \fIobj\fR and add it to
the NIS+ namespace with the name \fIname\fR. This operation will fail if the
client making the request does not have the \fIcreate\fR access right for the
domain in which this object will be added. The parameter \fIname\fR must
contain a fully qualified NIS+ name. The object members \fIzo_name\fR and
\fIzo_domain\fR will be constructed from this name. This operation will fail
if the object already exists. This feature prevents the accidental addition of
objects over another object that has been added by another process.
.sp
.LP
The function \fBnis_remove()\fR will remove the object with name \fIname\fR
from the NIS+ namespace. The client making this request must have the
\fIdestroy\fR access right for the domain in which this object resides.  If
the named object is a link, the link is removed and \fInot\fR the object that
it points to.  If the parameter \fIobj\fR is not \fINULL\fR, it is assumed to
point to a copy of the object being removed. In this case, if the object on
the server does not have the same object identifier as the object being
passed, the operation will fail with the \fBNIS_NOTSAMEOBJ\fR error. This
feature allows the client to insure that it is removing the desired object.
The parameter \fIname\fR must contain a fully qualified NIS+ name.
.sp
.LP
The function \fBnis_modify()\fR will modify the object named by \fIname\fR to
the field values  in the object pointed to by \fIobj\fR. This object should
contain a copy of the object from the name space that is being modified.  This
operation will fail with the error \fBNIS_NOTSAMEOBJ\fR if the object
identifier of the passed object does not match that of the object being
modified in the namespace.
.sp
.LP
Normally the contents of the member \fIzo_name\fR in the \fInis_object\fR
structure would be constructed from the name passed in the \fIname\fR
parameter. However, if it is non-null the client library will use the name in
the \fIzo_name\fR member to perform a rename operation on the object. This
name \fImust not\fR contain any unquoted `.'(dot) characters. If these
conditions are not met the operation will fail and return the
\fBNIS_BADNAME\fR error code.
.sp
.LP
You cannot modify the name of an object if that modification would cause the
object to reside in a different domain.
.sp
.LP
You cannot modify the schema of a table object.
.SS "Results"
.sp
.LP
These functions return a pointer to a structure of type \fBnis_result\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
struct nis_result {
	nis_error status;
	struct {
		uint_t	objects_len;
		nis_object	*objects_val;
	} objects;
	netobj	cookie;
	uint32_t	zticks;
	uint32_t	dticks;
	uint32_t	aticks;
	uint32_t	cticks;
};
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fIstatus\fR member contains the error status of the the operation. A
text message that describes the error can be obtained by calling the function
\fBnis_sperrno()\fR. See \fBnis_error\fR(3NSL).
.sp
.LP
The \fIobjects\fR structure contains two members. \fIobjects_val\fR is an
array of \fInis_object\fR structures; \fIobjects_len\fR is the number of cells
in the array. These objects will be freed by the call to
\fBnis_freeresult()\fR. If you need to keep a copy of one or more objects,
they can be copied with the function \fBnis_clone_object()\fR and freed with
the function \fBnis_destroy_object()\fR. See \fBnis_server\fR(3NSL). Refer to
\fBnis_objects\fR(3NSL) for a description of the  \fBnis_object\fR
structure.
.sp
.LP
The various ticks contain details of where the time was taken during a
request. They can be used to tune one's data organization for faster access
and to compare different database implementations.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIzticks\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The time spent in the NIS+ service itself. This count starts when the server
receives the request and stops when it sends the reply.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIdticks\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The time spent in the database backend. This time is measured from the time a
database call starts, until the result is returned. If the request results in
multiple calls to the database, this is the sum of all the time spent in those
calls.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIaticks\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The time spent in any ``accelerators'' or caches. This includes the time
required to locate the server needed to resolve the request.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIcticks\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The total time spent in the request. This clock starts when you  enter the
client library and stops when a result is returned. By subtracting the sum of
the other ticks values from this value, you can obtain the local overhead of
generating a NIS+ request.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Subtracting the value in \fIdticks\fR from the value in \fIzticks\fR will
yield the time spent in the service code itself. Subtracting the sum of the
values in \fIzticks\fR and  \fIaticks\fR from the value in  \fIcticks\fR will
yield the time spent in the client library itself. Note: all of the tick times
are measured in microseconds.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The client library can return a variety of error returns and diagnostics. The
more salient ones are documented below.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_SUCCESS\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
The request was successful.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_S_SUCCESS\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
The request was successful, however the object returned came from an object
cache and not directly from the server. If you do not wish to see objects from
object caches you must specify the flag  \fBNO_CACHE\fR when you call the
lookup function.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_NOTFOUND\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
The named object does not exist in the namespace.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_CACHEEXPIRED\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
The object returned came from an object cache taht has \fIexpired\fR. The
time to live value has gone to zero and the object may have changed. If the
flag \fBNO_CACHE\fR was passed to the lookup function then the lookup function
will retry the operation to get an unexpired copy of the object.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_NAMEUNREACHABLE\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
A server for the directory of the named object could not be reached. This can
occur when there is a network partition or all servers have crashed. See the
\fBHARD_LOOKUP\fR flag.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_UNKNOWNOBJ\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
The object returned is of an unknown type.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_TRYAGAIN\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt
The server connected to was too busy to handle your request.  For the
\fIadd\fR, \fIremove\fR, and \fImodify\fR operations this is returned when
either the master server for a  directory is unavailable, or it is in the
process of checkpointing its database. It can also be returned when the server
is updating its internal state. In the case of \fBnis_list()\fR,
\fBNIS_TRYAGAIN\fR is returned if the client specifies a callback and the
server does not have enough resources to handle the callback.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBNIS_SYSTEMERROR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
