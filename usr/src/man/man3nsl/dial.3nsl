.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B dial()
function returns a file-descriptor for a terminal line
open for read/write. The argument to
.B dial()
is a
.B CALL
structure
(defined in the header <\fBdial.h\fR>).
.sp
.LP
When finished with the terminal line, the calling program must  invoke
\fBundial()\fR to release the semaphore that has been set during the
allocation of the terminal device.
.sp
.LP
\fBCALL\fR is defined in the header <\fBdial.h\fR> and has the following
members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
struct termio *attr;	  /* pointer to termio attribute struct */
int           baud;	   /* transmission data rate */
int           speed;	   /* 212A modem: low=300, high=1200 */
char          *line;	   /* device name for out-going line */
char          *telno;	 /* pointer to tel-no digits string */
int           modem;	   /* specify modem control for direct lines */
char          *device;	/* unused */
int           dev_len;	/* unused */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The
.B CALL
element
.B speed
is intended only for use with an
outgoing dialed call, in which case its value should be the desired
transmission baud rate.  The
.B CALL
element
.B baud
is no longer
used.
.sp
.LP
If the desired terminal line is a direct line, a string pointer to its
device-name should be placed in the
.B line
element in the
.BR CALL
structure. Legal values for such terminal device names are kept in the
\fBDevices\fR file. In this case, the value of the \fBbaud\fR element should
be set to -1. This value will cause
.B dial
to determine the correct
value from the
.B <Devices>
file.
.sp
.LP
The
.B telno
element is for a pointer to a character string representing
the telephone number to be dialed. Such numbers may consist only of these
characters:
.sp

.sp
.TS

lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i)
lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i)

-delay for approximately 4 seconds
.TE

.sp
.LP
The
.B CALL
element
.B modem
is used to specify modem control for
direct lines. This element should be non-zero if modem control is required.
The
.B CALL
element
.B attr
is a pointer to a
.B termio
structure,
as defined in the header
.BR <termio.h> \&.
A
.I NULL
value for this
pointer element may be passed to the
.B dial
function, but if such a
structure is included, the elements specified in it will be set for the
outgoing terminal line before the connection is established. This setting is
often important for certain attributes such as parity and baud-rate.
.sp
.LP
The
.B CALL
elements
.B device
and
.B dev_len
are no longer used.
They are retained in the
.B CALL
structure for compatibility reasons.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
On failure, a negative value indicating the reason for the failure will be
returned. Mnemonics for these negative indices as listed here are defined in
the header <\fBdial.h\fR>.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Including the header <\fBdial.h\fR> automatically includes the header
\fB<termio.h>\fR\&. An
.BR alarm (2)
system call for 3600 seconds is made
(and caught) within the
.B dial
module for the purpose of ``touching''
the
.B LCK..
file and constitutes the device allocation semaphore for the
terminal device. Otherwise, \fBuucp\fR(1C) may simply delete the \fBLCK..\fR
entry on its 90-minute clean-up rounds. The alarm may go off while the user
program is in a
.BR read (2)
or
.BR write (2)
function, causing an
apparent error return. If the user program expects to be around for an hour
or more, error returns from \fBread()\fRs should be checked for
.BR (errno==EINTR) ,
and the
.B read()
possibly reissued.
