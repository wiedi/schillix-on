.SH NAME
rpc_gss_get_principal_name \- Get principal names at server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <rpc/rpcsec_gss.h>

\fBbool_t\fR \fBrpc_gss_get_principal_name\fR(\fBrpc_gss_principal_\fR \fI*principal\fR,
     \fBchar\fR \fI*mech\fR, \fBchar\fR \fI*name\fR, \fBchar\fR \fI*node\fR, \fBchar\fR \fI*domain\fR);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Servers need to be able to operate on a client's principal name. Such a
name is stored by the server as a  \fBrpc_gss_principal_t\fR structure, an
opaque byte string which can be used either directly in access control lists
or as database indices which can be used to look up a UNIX credential. A
server may, for example, need to compare a principal name it has received
with the principal name of a known entity, and to do that, it must be able
to generate \fBrpc_gss_principal_t\fR structures from known entities.
.sp
.LP
\fBrpc_gss_get_principal_name()\fR takes as input a security mechanism, a
pointer to a \fBrpc_gss_principal_t\fR structure, and several parameters
which uniquely identify an entity on a network: a user or service name, a
node name, and a domain name.  From these parameters it constructs a unique,
mechanism-dependent principal name of the \fBrpc_gss_principal_t\fR
structure type.
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.LP
How many of the identifying parameters  (\fIname \fR,  \fInode\fR, and \fI
\fRdomain\fI)\fR are necessary to specify depends on the mechanism being
used. For example, Kerberos V5 requires only a user name but can accept a
node and domain name. An application can choose to set unneeded parameters
to \fINULL.\fR

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Principal names may be freed up by a call to \fBfree\fR(3C). A principal
name need only be freed in those instances where it was constructed by the
application. (Values returned by other routines point to structures already
existing in a  context, and need not be freed.)
