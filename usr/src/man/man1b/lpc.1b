.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B lpc
utility controls the operation of local printers.
.sp
.LP
Use
.B lpc
to perform the following functions:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
start or stop a printer,
.RE
.RS +4

.RE
.RS +4

display the status of a printer print queue and printer daemon.

\fBlpc\fR can be run from the command line or interactively. Specifying
\fBlpc\fR with the optional \fIcommand\fR and\fIparameter\fR arguments causes
\fBlpc\fR to interpret the first argument as an \fBlpc\fR command, and all other
arguments as parameters to that command. Specifying
.B lpc
without arguments
causes it to run interactively, prompting the user for
.B lpc
commands with
.BR lpc> .
By redirecting the standard input,
.B lpc
can read commands from a
file.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
\fBlpc\fR commands can be typed in their entirety or abbreviated to an
unambiguous substring. Some
.B lpc
commands are available to all users; others
are available only to super-users.
.sp

All users can execute the following
.B lpc
