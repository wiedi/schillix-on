.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
The \fBlptest\fR utility writes the traditional \fIripple test\fR pattern to the standard output. In 96 lines, the ripple test pattern prints all 96 printable \fBASCII\fR characters in each position. The ripple test pattern was originally created to test printers.  It is also useful for testing terminals, driving terminal ports, debugging, and performing tasks that require a quick supply of random data.
