.SH NAME
sum \- calculate a checksum for a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/ucb/sum\fR \fIfile\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
.B sum
calculates and displays a 16-bit checksum for the named file and
displays the size of the file in kilobytes. It is typically used to look for
bad spots, or to validate a file communicated over some transmission line.
The checksum is calculated by an algorithm which may yield different results
on machines with 16-bit \fBint\fRs and machines with 32-bit \fBint\fRs, so
it cannot always be used to validate that a file has been transferred
between machines with different-sized \fBint\fRs.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
See
.BR largefile (5)
for the description of the behavior of
.BR sum
when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp

.B Read error
is indistinguishable from
.B EOF
on most devices; check
the block count.
.SH NOTES

.B sum
and
.B /usr/bin/sum
(see
.BR sum (1))
return different
checksums.
