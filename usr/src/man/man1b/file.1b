.SH NAME
file \- determine the type of a file by examining its contents
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

\fB/usr/ucb/file\fR [\fB-f\fR \fIffile\fR] [\fB-cL\fR] [\fB-m\fR \fImfile\fR] \fIfilename\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBfile\fR performs a series of tests on each  \fIfilename\fR in an attempt
to determine what it contains. If the contents of a file appear to be
\fBASCII\fR text, \fBfile\fR examines the first 512 bytes and tries to guess
its language.
.sp
.LP
\fBfile\fR uses the file \fB/etc/magic\fR to identify files that have some
sort of
.IR "magic number" ,
that is, any file containing a numeric or string
constant that indicates its type.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -c
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
Check for format errors in the magic number file. For reasons of
efficiency, this validation is not normally carried out. No file
type-checking is done under \fB-c\fR.

If a file is a symbolic link, test the file the link references rather than
the link itself.

Use \fImfile\fR as the name of an alternate magic number file.

.SH EXAMPLES

\fBExample 1\fR Using \fBfile\fR on all the files in a specific user's
directory.
.sp
.LP
This example illustrates the use of \fBfile\fR on all the files in a
specific user's directory:

.in +2
.nf
example% \fBpwd
/usr/blort/misc\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fB/usr/ucb/file  *\fR

code:           mc68020 demand paged executable
code.c:         c program text
counts:         ascii text
doc:            roff,nroff, or eqn input text
empty.file:     empty
libz:           archive random library
memos:          directory
project:        symboliclink to /usr/project
script:         executable shell script
titles:         ascii text
s5.stuff:       cpio archive

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
The environment variables
.BR LC_CTYPE ,
.BR LANG ,
and \fBLC_default\fR
control the character classification throughout
.BR file .
On entry to
\fBfile\fR, these environment variables are checked in the following order:
.BR LC_CTYPE ,
.BR LANG ,
and
.BR LC_default .
When a valid value is
found, remaining environment variables for character classification are
ignored. For example, a new setting for
.B LANG
does not override the
current valid character classification rules of
.BR LC_CTYPE .
When none of
the values is valid, the shell character classification defaults to the
POSIX.1 "C"  locale.

\fBfile\fR often makes mistakes.  In particular, it often suggests that
command files are C programs.
