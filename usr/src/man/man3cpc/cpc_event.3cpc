.TH cpc_event 3CPC "12 May 2003" "SunOS 5.11" "CPU Performance Counters Library Functions"
.SH NAME
cpc_event \- data structure to describe CPU performance counters
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <libcpc.h>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B libcpc
interfaces manipulate CPU performance counters using the
.B cpc_event_t
data structure. This structure contains several fields
that are common to all processors, and some that are processor-dependent.
These structures can be declared by a consumer of the API, thus the size and
offsets of the fields and the entire data structure are fixed per processor
for any particular version of the library. See  \fBcpc_version\fR(3CPC) for
details of library versioning.
.SS "SPARC"
.sp
.LP
For UltraSPARC, the structure contains the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
typedef struct {
        int ce_cpuver;
        hrtime_t ce_hrt;
        uint64_t ce_tick;
        uint64_t ce_pic[2];
        uint64_t ce_pcr;
} cpc_event_t;
.fi
.in -2

.SS "x86"
.sp
.LP
For Pentium, the structure contains the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBtypedef struct {
        int ce_cpuver;
        hrtime_t ce_hrt;
        uint64_t ce_tsc;
        uint64_t ce_pic[2];
        uint32_t ce_pes[2];
#define ce_cesr ce_pes[0]
} cpc_event_t;\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The APIs are used to manipulate the highly processor-dependent control
registers (the
.BR ce_pcr ,
.BR ce_cesr ,
and
.B ce_pes
fields); the
programmer is strongly advised not to reference those fields directly in
portable code. The
.B ce_pic
array elements contain 64-bit accumulated
counter values.  The hardware registers are virtualized to 64-bit quantities
even though the underlying hardware only supports 32-bits (UltraSPARC) or
40-bits (Pentium) before overflow.
.sp
.LP
The
.B ce_hrt
field is a high resolution timestamp taken at the time
the counters were sampled by the kernel.  This uses the same timebase as
.BR gethrtime (3C).
.sp
.LP
On SPARC V9 machines, the number of cycles spent running on the processor
is computed from samples of the processor-dependent
.B %tick
register,
and placed in the
.B ce_tick
field. On Pentium processors, the
processor-dependent time-stamp counter register is similarly sampled and
placed in the
.B ce_tsc
field.
