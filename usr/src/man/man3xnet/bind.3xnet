.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcc\fR [ \fIflag\fR .\|.\|. ] \fIfile\fR .\|.\|. \fB-lxnet\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR .\|.\|. ]
#include <sys/socket.h>

\fBint\fR \fBbind\fR(\fBint\fR \fIsocket\fR, \fBconst struct sockaddr *\fIaddress\fR,
     \fBsocklen_t\fR \fIaddress_len\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBbind()\fR function assigns an \fIaddress\fR to an unnamed socket.
Sockets created with \fBsocket\fR(3XNET) function are initially unnamed.
They are identified only by their address family.
.sp
.LP
The function takes the following arguments:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIsocket\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Specifies the file descriptor of the socket to be bound.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIaddress\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Points to a \fBsockaddr\fR structure containing the address to be bound to
the socket.  The length and format of the address depend on the address
family of the socket.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIaddress_len\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Specifies the length of the \fBsockaddr\fR structure pointed to by the
\fIaddress\fR argument.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate privileges to
use the \fBbind()\fR function.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
An application program can retrieve the assigned socket name with the
\fBgetsockname\fR(3XNET) function.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBbind()\fR returns 0.  Otherwise, \(mi1 is
returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBbind()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEADDRINUSE\fR
.ad

The specified address is already in use.
.RE
