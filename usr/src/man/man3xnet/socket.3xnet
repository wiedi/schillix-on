.SH NAME
socket \- create an endpoint for communication

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B socket()
function creates an unbound socket in a communications
domain, and returns a file descriptor that can be used in later function
calls that operate on sockets.
.sp
.LP
The <\fBsys/socket.h\fR> header defines at least the following values for
the
.I domain
argument:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B AF_UNIX
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
File system pathnames.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B AF_INET
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B AF_INET6
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) address.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The
.I type
argument specifies the socket type, which determines the
semantics of communication over the socket.  The socket types supported by
the system are implementation-dependent.  Possible socket types include:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B SOCK_STREAM
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional, connection-mode byte streams,
and may provide a transmission mechanism for out-of-band data.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B SOCK_DGRAM
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Provides datagrams, which are connectionless-mode, unreliable messages of
fixed maximum length.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B SOCK_SEQPACKET
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional, connection-mode transmission
path for records.  A record can be sent using one or more output operations
and received using one or more input operations, but a single operation
never transfers part of more than one record.  Record boundaries are visible
to the receiver via the MSG_EOR flag.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If the
.I protocol
argument is non-zero, it must specify a protocol that
is supported by the address family.  The protocols supported by the system
are implementation-dependent.
.sp
.LP
The process may need to have appropriate privileges to use the
.B socket()
function or to create some sockets.
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.LP
The function takes the following arguments:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I domain
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
Specifies the communications domain in which a socket is to be created.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I type
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
Specifies the type of socket to be created.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I protocol
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
Specifies a particular protocol to be used with the socket. Specifying a
.I protocol
of 0 causes
.B socket()
to use an unspecified default
protocol appropriate for the requested socket type.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The
.I domain
argument specifies the address family used in the
communications domain.  The address families supported by the system are
implementation-dependent.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The documentation for specific address families specify which protocols
each address family supports.  The documentation for specific protocols
specify which socket types each protocol supports.
.sp
.LP
The application can determine if an address family is supported by trying
to create a socket with
.I domain
set to the protocol in question.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B socket()
returns a nonnegative integer,
the socket file descriptor.  Otherwise a value of
.B -1
is returned and
.B errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B socket()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EAFNOSUPPORT
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
The implementation does not support the specified address family.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EMFILE
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
No more file descriptors are available for this process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENFILE
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
No more file descriptors are available for the system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EPROTONOSUPPORT
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
The protocol is not supported by the address family, or the protocol is not
supported by the implementation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EPROTOTYPE
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
The socket type is not supported by the protocol.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The
.B socket()
function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EACCES
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
The process does not have appropriate privileges.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENOBUFS
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the
operation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENOMEM
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENOSR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
There were insufficient STREAMS resources available for the operation to
complete.
