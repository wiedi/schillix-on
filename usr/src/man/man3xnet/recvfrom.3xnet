.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrecvfrom()\fR function receives a message from a connection-mode or
connectionless-mode socket.  It is normally used with connectionless-mode
sockets because it permits the application to retrieve the source address of
received data.
.sp
.LP
The function takes the following arguments:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I socket
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Specifies the socket file descriptor.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIbuffer\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Points to the buffer where the message should be stored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I length
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Specifies the length in bytes of the buffer pointed to by the \fIbuffer\fR
argument.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIflags\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Specifies the type of message reception.  Values of this argument are
formed by logically OR'ing zero or more of the following values:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B MSG_PEEK
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Peeks at an incoming message.  The data is treated as unread and the next
\fBrecvfrom()\fR or similar function will still return this data.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B MSG_OOB
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Requests out-of-band data. The significance and semantics of out-of-band
data are protocol-specific.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B MSG_WAITALL
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Requests that the function block until the full amount of data requested
can be returned.  The function may return a smaller amount of data if a
signal is caught,  if the connection is terminated,  if MSG_PEEK was
specified, or if an error is pending for the socket.
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I address
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
A null pointer, or points to a
.B sockaddr
structure in which the
sending address is to be stored.  The length and format of the address
depend on the address family of the socket.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I address_len
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Specifies the length of the
.B sockaddr
structure pointed to by the
\fIaddress\fR argument.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBrecvfrom()\fR function returns the length of the message written to
the buffer pointed to by the \fIbuffer\fR argument.  For message-based
sockets such as
.B SOCK_DGRAM
and
.BR SOCK_SEQPACKET ,
the entire
message must be read in a single operation.  If a message is too long to fit
in the supplied buffer, and
.B MSG_PEEK
is not set in the \fIflags\fR
argument, the excess bytes are discarded.  For stream-based sockets such as
.BR SOCK_STREAM ,
message boundaries are ignored.  In this case, data is
returned to the user as soon as it becomes available, and no data is
discarded.
.sp
.LP
If the
.B MSG_WAITALL
flag is not set, data will be returned only up to
the end of the first message.
.sp
.LP
Not all protocols provide the source address for messages.  If the
\fIaddress\fR argument is not a null pointer and the protocol provides the
source address of messages, the source address of the received message is
stored in the
.B sockaddr
structure pointed to by the
.IR address
argument, and the length of this address is stored in the object pointed to
by the
.I address_len
argument.
.sp
.LP
If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of the
supplied
.B sockaddr
structure, the stored address will be truncated.
.sp
.LP
If the
.I address
argument is not a null pointer and the protocol does
not provide the source address of messages, the the value stored in the
object pointed to by
.I address
is unspecified.
.sp
.LP
If no messages are available at the socket and
.B O_NONBLOCK
is not set
on the socket's file descriptor, \fBrecvfrom()\fR blocks until a message
arrives. If no messages are available at the socket and
.B O_NONBLOCK
is
set on the socket's file descriptor, \fBrecvfrom()\fR fails and sets
\fBerrno\fR to \fBEAGAIN\fR or \fBEWOULDBLOCK\fR.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The
.BR select "(3C) and"
.BR poll (2)
functions can be used to determine
when data is available to be received.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBrecvfrom()\fR returns the length of the
message in bytes.  If no messages are available to be received and the peer
has performed an orderly shutdown, \fBrecvfrom()\fR returns 0.  Otherwise
the function returns \(mi1 and sets
.B errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBrecvfrom()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EAGAIN
.ad
.br
.na
.B EWOULDBLOCK
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
The socket's file descriptor is marked
.B O_NONBLOCK
and no data is
waiting to be received, or
.B MSG_OOB
is set and no out-of-band data is
available and either the socket's file descriptor is marked \fBO_NONBLOCK\fR
or the socket does not support blocking to await out-of-band data.
