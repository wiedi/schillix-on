.SH NAME
kvm_nlist \- get entries from kernel symbol table
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
\fBcc\fR [ \fIflag\fR\&.\|.\|. ] \fIfile\fR\&.\|.\|. \fB-lkvm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR\&.\|.\|.]
#include <kvm.h>

\fBint\fR \fBkvm_nlist\fR(\fBkvm_t *\fIkd\fR, \fBstruct nlist *\fInl\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBkvm_nlist()\fR function examines the symbol table from the kernel
image identified by \fIkd\fR (see \fBkvm_open\fR(3KVM)) and selectively
extracts a list of values and puts them in the array of \fBnlist\fR
structures pointed to by \fInl\fR. The name list pointed to by \fInl\fR
consists of an array of structures containing names, types and values.  The
\fBn_name\fR field of each such structure is taken to be a pointer to a
character string representing a symbol name.  The list is terminated by an
entry with a null pointer (or a pointer to a null string) in the
\fBn_name\fR field.  For each entry in \fInl\fR, if the named symbol is
present in the kernel symbol table, its value and type are placed in the
\fBn_value\fR and \fBn_type\fR fields. If a symbol cannot be located, the
corresponding \fBn_type\fR field of \fInl\fR is set to 0.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBkvm_nlist()\fR functions returns the value of  \fBnlist\fR(3UCB) or
\fBnlist\fR(3ELF), depending on the library used.
