.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrsm_memseg_export_publish()\fR, \fBrsm_memseg_export_unpublish()\fR,
and \fBrsm_memseg_export_republish()\fR functions allow or disallow a memory
segment to be imported by other nodes.
.sp
.LP
The rsm_memseg_export_publish(3RSM) function allows the export segment
specified by the \fImemseg\fR argument to be imported by other nodes. It
also assigns a unique segment identifier to the segment and defines the
access control list for the segment. The \fIsegment_id\fR argument is a
pointer to an identifier which is unique on the publishing node. It is the
responsibility of the application to manage the assignment of unique segment
identifiers. The identifier can be optionally initialized to 0, in which
case the system will return a unique segment identifier value.  The
\fIaccess_list\fR argument is composed of pairs of nodeid and access
permissions. For each nodeid specified in the list, the associated
read/write permissions are provided by three octal digits for owner, group,
and other, as for Solaris file permissions. In the access control each octal
digit may have the following values:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB2\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
write access
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB6\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
read and write access
.RE

.sp
.LP
An access permissions value of 0624 specifies: (1) an importer with the
same uid as the exporter has read and write access; (2) an importer with the
same gid as the exporter has write access only; and (3) all other importers
have read access only. When an access control list is provided, nodes not
included in the list will be prevented from importing the segment.  However,
if the access list is \fINULL\fR (this will require the length
\fIaccess_list_length\fR to be specified as 0 as well), then no nodes will
be excluded from importing and the access permissions on all nodes will
equal the owner-group-other file creation permissions of the exporting
process. Corresponding to the \fIaccess_list\fR argument, the
\fIaccess_list_length\fR argument specifies the number of entries in the
\fIaccess_list\fR array.
.sp
.LP
The \fBrsm_memseg_export_unpublish()\fR function disallows the export
segment specified by \fImemseg\fR from being imported. All the existing
import connections are forcibly disconnected.
.sp
.LP
The \fBrsm_memseg_export_republish()\fR function changes the access control
list for the exported and published segment. Although the current import
connections remain unaffected by this call, new connections are constrained
by the new  access list.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return 0. Otherwise, an error
value is returned to indicate the error.
