.SH NAME
rsm_intr_signal_wait_pollfd \- wait for events on a list of file
descriptors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR\&.\|.\|. \fB-lrsm\fR [ \fIlibrary \&.\|.\|.\fR ]
#include <rsmapi.h>

\fBint\fR \fBrsm_intr_signal_wait_pollfd\fR(\fBstruct pollfd\fR \fIfds\fR[],
     \fBnfds_t\fR \fInfds\fR, \fBint\fR \fItimeout\fR, \fBint *\fInumfdsp\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrsm_intr_signal_wait_pollfd()\fR function is similar to
\fBrsm_intr_signal_wait\fR(3RSM), except that it  allows an application to
multiplex I/O over various types of file descriptors. Applications can use
this function to wait for interrupt signals on RSMAPI segments as well as
poll for I/O events on other non-RSMAPI file descriptors.
.sp
.LP
The \fIfds\fR argument is an array of \fBpollfd\fR structures that
correspond to both RSMAPI segments and other file descriptors. The
\fBrsm_memseg_get_pollfd\fR(3RSM) is used to obtain a \fBpollfd\fR structure
corresponding to an RSMAPI segment.
.sp
.LP
The number of file descriptors that have events is returned in
\fInumfdsp\fR. This parameter can be set to \fINULL\fR if the application is
not interested in the number of file descriptors that have events. See
\fBpoll\fR(2) for descriptions of the \fBpollfd\fR structure as well as the
\fInfds\fR and \fItimeout\fR parameters.
.sp
.LP
It is the application's responsibility to establish the validity of a
\fBpollfd\fR structure corresponding to an RSMAPI segment by ensuring that
\fBrsm_memseg_release_pollfd\fR(3RSM) has not been called on the segment or
that the segment has not been destroyed.
.sp
.LP
For file descriptors other than RSMAPI segments, the behavior of
\fBrsm_intr_signal_wait_pollfd()\fR is similar to \fBpoll()\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBrsm_intr_signal_wait_pollfd()\fR returns 0
and the \fBrevents\fR member of the \fBpollfd\fR struct corresponding to an
RSMAPI segment is set to \fBPOLLRDNORM\fR, indicating that an interrupt
signal for that segment was received. Otherwise, an error value is
returned.
.sp
.LP
For file descriptors other than RSMAPI segments, the \fBrevents\fR member
of the \fBpollfd\fR struct is identical to that returned by \fBpoll\fR(2).
