.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Interfaces in this library provide functions for multimedia processing.
Multi-threaded (MT) mediaLib is a software layer developed on top of
mediaLib using OpenMP.  When it is used with a large data set on a
multi-processor system, MT mediaLib will partition data into subsets and
process the subsets in parallel, thus greatly improving performance of
applications that use mediaLib.
.SH INTERFACES
.sp
.LP
The shared object
.B libmlib_mt.so.2
provides the same public interfaces
as those defined in
.BR libmlib "(3LIB). See"
.BR Intro (3)
for additional
information on shared object interfaces.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
There are two ways to use MT mediaLib.
.RS +4
.TP
1.
Pre-load a multi-threaded mediaLib library during runtime by setting the
.B LD_PRELOAD
environment variable as follows before starting your
application, in Bourne/Korn shell:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
LD_PRELOAD=libmlib_mt.so
export LD_PRELOAD
.fi
.in -2

or in C shell:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
setenv LD_PRELOAD libmlib_mt.so
.fi
.in -2

In this way, you can take advantage of MT mediaLib without rebuilding your
application.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
Link your application with a multi-threaded mediaLib library directly as
shown under SYNOPSIS.  In this way, an MT mediaLib library is always used
whenever your application is started.
.RE
.sp
.LP
The parallelization of MT mediaLib is controlled, in part, by the
.B PARALLEL
environment variable.  You can change its setting to adjust
the degree of parallelization before starting your application,  in
Bourne/Korn shell:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
PARALLEL=n
export PARALLEL
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
or in C shell:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
setenv PARALLEL n
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
where
.B n
is a positive integer for number of threads. Note that other
factors also affect the degree of parallelization in MT mediaLib.
