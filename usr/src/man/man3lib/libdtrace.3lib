.SH NAME
libdtrace \- DTrace dynamic tracing software library
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Functions in this library define the interface for interacting with the
DTrace dynamic tracing software, including the D language compiler and
facilities for enabling probes and consuming trace data.
.SH INTERFACES
.sp
.LP
The interfaces provided by libdtrace.so.1 are currently private to the
implementation of the Solaris system and DTrace subsystem and are subject to
change at any time without notice.  Applications using these interfaces
might fail to run on future releases. Refer to the \fISolaris Dynamic
Tracing Guide\fR for a description of the public documented interfaces
available for the DTrace facility.
