.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Functions in this library provide conversions between ACE string and
multibyte character string of the current locale or a specified codeset.
They support various manipulations of internationalized domain names,
including encoding conversion and name preparation. They are designed
according to IDNA framework where each application must do necessary
preparations for the internationalized domain names before passing them to
the resolver. The library provides easy-to-use, high-level interfaces to
help applications with the preparation.
.sp
.LP
The
.B libidnkit
library internally uses
.BR iconv "(3C) to provide"
encoding conversion from UTF-8 to the local encoding (such as ISO8859-1,
usually determined by the current locale), and from the local encoding to
UTF-8.
