.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B rcmd()
function is used by the superuser to execute a command on
a remote machine with an authentication scheme based on reserved port
numbers. An
.B AF_INET
socket is returned with
.BR rcmd() .
The
.B rcmd_af()
function supports
.BR AF_INET ,
.B AF_INET6
or
.B AF_UNSPEC
for the address family. An application can choose which type
of socket is returned by passing
.B AF_INET
or
.B AF_INET6
as the
address family. The use of
.B AF_UNSPEC
means that the caller will accept
any address family. Choosing
.B AF_UNSPEC
provides a socket that best
suits the connectivity to the remote host.
.sp
.LP
The
.B rresvport()
function returns a descriptor to a socket with an
address in the privileged port space. The
.B rresvport_af()
function is
the equivalent to
.BR rresvport() ,
except that you can choose
.B AF_INET
or
.B AF_INET6
as the socket address family to be returned
by
.BR rresvport_af() .
.B AF_UNSPEC
does not apply to the
.B rresvport()
function.
.sp
.LP
The
.B ruserok()
function is a routine used by servers to authenticate
clients that request as service with
.BR rcmd .
.sp
.LP
All of these functions are present in the same file and are used by the
.BR in.rshd (1M)
server among others.
.sp
.LP
The
.B rcmd()
and
.B rcmd_af()
functions look up the host
.I *ahost
using
.BR getaddrinfo (3SOCKET)
and return
.B \(mi1
if the
host does not exist. Otherwise,
.RI * ahost
is set to the standard name of
the host and a connection is established to a server residing at the
Internet port
.IR inport .
.sp
.LP
If the connection succeeds, a socket in the Internet domain of type
.B SOCK_STREAM
is returned to the caller. The socket is given to the
remote command as standard input (file descriptor 0) and standard output
(file descriptor 1). If
.I fd2p
is non-zero, an auxiliary channel to a
control process is set up and a descriptor for it is placed in
.IR *fd2p .
The control process returns diagnostic output file (descriptor 2) from the
command on the auxiliary channel. The control process also accepts bytes on
this channel as signal numbers to be forwarded to the process group of the
command. If
.I fd2p
is 0, the standard error (file descriptor 2) of the
remote command is made the same as its standard output. No provision is made
for sending arbitrary signals to the remote process, other than possibly
sending out-of-band data.
.sp
.LP
The protocol is described in detail in
.BR in.rshd (1M).
.sp
.LP
The
.B rresvport()
and
.B rresvport_af()
functions are used to obtain
a socket bound to a privileged port number. The socket is suitable for use
by
.B rcmd()
and
.B rresvport_af()
and several other routines.
Privileged Internet ports are those in the range 1 to 1023. Only the
superuser is allowed to bind a socket to a privileged port number. The
application must pass in
.IR port ,
which must be in the range 512 to 1023.
The system first tries to bind to that port number.  If it fails, the system
then tries to bind to another unused privileged port, if one is available.

.sp
.LP
The
.B ruserok()
function takes a remote host name returned by the
.B gethostbyaddr()
function with two user names and a flag to indicate
whether the local user's name is that of the superuser. See
.BR gethostbyname (3NSL).
The
.B ruserok()
function then checks the
files
.B /etc/hosts.equiv
and possibly
.B \&.rhosts
in the local
user's home directory to see if the request for service is allowed. A
.B 0
value is returned if the machine name is listed in the
.B /etc/hosts.equiv
file, or if the host and remote user name are found
in the
.B \&.rhosts
file. Otherwise, the
.B ruserok()
function returns
.BR \(mi1 \&.
If the superuser flag is
.BR 1 ,
the
.BR /etc/hosts.equiv
is not checked.
.sp
.LP
The error code
.B
EAGAIN
is overloaded to mean "All network ports in
use."
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The
.B rcmd()
and
.B rcmd_af()
functions return a valid socket
descriptor upon success. The functions returns
.B \(mi1
upon error and
print a diagnostic message to standard error.
.sp
.LP
The
.B rresvport()
and
.B rresvport_af()
functions return a valid,
bound socket descriptor upon success. The functions return
.B \(mi1
upon
error with the global value
.I errno
set according to the reason for
failure.
