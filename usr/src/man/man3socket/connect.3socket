\fBint\fR \fBconnect\fR(\fBint\fR \fIs\fR, \fBconst struct sockaddr *\fIname\fR, \fBint\fR \fInamelen\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The parameter \fIs\fR is a socket. If it is of type \fBSOCK_DGRAM\fR,
\fBconnect()\fR specifies the peer with which the socket is to be
associated. This address is the address to which datagrams are to be sent if
a receiver is not explicitly designated. This address is the only address
from which datagrams are to be received. If the socket \fIs\fR is of type
\fBSOCK_STREAM\fR, \fBconnect()\fR attempts to make a connection to another
socket. The other socket is specified by \fIname\fR. \fIname\fR is an
address in the communication space of the socket. Each communication space
interprets the \fIname\fR parameter in its own way. If \fIs\fR is not bound,
then \fIs\fR will be bound to an address selected by the underlying
transport provider. Generally, stream sockets can successfully
\fBconnect()\fR only once. Datagram sockets can use \fBconnect()\fR multiple
times to change their association. Datagram sockets can dissolve the
association by connecting to a null address.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If the connection or binding succeeds, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise,
\fB\(mi1\fR is returned and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp

The call fails if:
.sp

Addresses in the specified address family cannot be used with this
socket.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fBEALREADY\fR
.ad
.RS 17n

The socket is non-blocking,  and a previous connection attempt has not yet
been completed.
.RE

\fIs\fR is not a valid descriptor.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBECONNREFUSED\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
The attempt to connect was forcefully rejected. The calling program should
\fBclose\fR(2) the socket descriptor, and issue another
\fBsocket\fR(3SOCKET) call to obtain a new descriptor before attempting
another \fBconnect()\fR call.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEINPROGRESS\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
The socket is non-blocking, and the connection cannot be completed
immediately. You can use  \fBselect\fR(3C) to complete the connection by
selecting the socket for writing.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEINTR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
The connection attempt was interrupted before any data arrived by the
delivery of a signal. The connection, however, will be established
asynchronously.

The file that is referred to by \fIname\fR is a socket of a type other than
type \fIs\fR. For example, \fIs\fR is a \fBSOCK_DGRAM\fR socket, while
\fIname\fR refers to a \fBSOCK_STREAM\fR socket.
