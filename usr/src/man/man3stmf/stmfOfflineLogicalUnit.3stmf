.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBstmfOfflineLogicalUnit()\fR function takes offline a logical unit
that is currently in the online state. Once in the offline state, the
logical unit will no longer be capable of servicing requests in the
system.
.sp
.LP
This API call can be used to take offline a logical unit for servicing.
Once the logical unit is offline, an initiator port that attempts to issue
any SCSI commands to the offlined logical unit will receive a check
condition. For purposes of the REPORT LUNS command, the logical unit will no
longer appear in the logical unit inventory for any initiator ports to which
it is currently mapped by one or more view entries.
