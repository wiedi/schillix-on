.SH NAME
syncinit \- set serial line interface operating parameters
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/syncinit\fR \fIdevice\fR
     [ [\fIbaud_rate\fR] | [\fIkeyword\fR=\fIvalue\fR,].\|.\|. | [\fIsingle-word\fR \fIoption\fR]]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B syncinit
utility allows the user to modify some of the hardware
operating modes common to synchronous serial lines. This can be useful in
troubleshooting a link, or necessary to the operation of a communications
package.
.sp
.LP
If run without options,
.B syncinit
reports the options as presently set on
the port. If options are specified, the new settings are reported after they have
been made.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
Options to
.B syncinit
normally take the form of a keyword, followed by an
equal sign and a value. The exception is that a baud rate may be specified as a
decimal integer by itself. Keywords must begin with the value shown in the
options table, but may contain additional letters up to the equal sign. For
example,
.B loop=
and
.B loopback=
are equivalent.
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:

lw(.87i) lw(.87i) lw(3.76i)

\fBKeyword\fR\fBValue\fR\fBEffect\fR
\fBloop\fRyesT{
Set the port to operate in \fBinternal loopback\fR mode. The receiver is electrically disconnected from the DCE receive data input and tied to the outgoing transmit data line. Transmit data is available to the DCE. The Digital Phase-Locked Loop (DPLL) may not be used as a clock source in this mode. If no other clocking options have been specified, perform the equivalent of \fBtxc=baud\fR and \fBrxc=baud\fR.
T}
noT{
Disable internal loopback mode.  If no other clocking options have been specified, perform the equivalent of \fBtxc=txc\fR and \fBrxc=rxc\fR.
T}
\fBecho\fRyesT{
Set the port to operate in \fBauto-echo\fR mode.  The transmit data output is electrically disconnected from the transmitter and tied to the receive data input. Incoming receive data is still visible.  Use of this mode in combination with local loopback mode has no value, and should be rejected by the device driver. The \fBauto-echo\fR mode is useful to make a system become the endpoint of a remote loopback test.

\fBExample 1\fR Using \fBsyncinit\fR
.sp
.LP
The following command sets the first CPU port to loop internally, using internal
clocking and operating at 38400 baud:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# syncinit zsh0 38400 loop=yes
device: /dev/zsh  ppa: 0
speed=38400, loopback=yes, echo=no, nrzi=no, txc=baud, rxc=baud
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The following command sets the same port's clocking, local loopback and baud
rate settings to their default values:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# syncinit zsh0 stop loop=no
device: /dev/zsh  ppa: 0
speed=0, loopback=no, echo=no, nrzi=no, txc=txc, rxc=rxc

error condition. Do not use this command casually or without being aware of the
consequences.
