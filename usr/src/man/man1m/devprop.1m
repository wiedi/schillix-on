.TH devprop 1M "26 Sep 2007" "SunOS 5.11" "System Administration Commands"
.SH NAME
devprop \- display device properties
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/sbin/devprop\fR [\fB-n\fR \fIdevice-path\fR] [\fB-vq\fR] [-\fB{b|i|l|s}\fR] [\fIproperty\fR[.\|.\|.]]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdevprop\fR command displays named device properties from the device
tree.
.sp
.LP
If a device path is specified on the command line, \fBdevprop\fR displays
device properties for that device node.
.sp
.LP
The output formats, while Volatile, are patterned after those of
\fBprtconf\fR(1M).
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-b\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The properties to be output are sequences of bytes
(\fBDI_PROP_TYPE_BYTES\fR). \fB-b\fR, \fB-i\fR, \fB-l\fR, and \fB-s\fR are
mutually exclusive of one another.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-i\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The properties to be output are integers (\fBDI_PROP_TYPE_INT\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-l\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The properties to be output are 64-bit integers
(\fBDI_PROP_TYPE_INT64\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-s\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The properties to be output are strings (\fBDI_PROP_TYPE_STRING\fR) (the
default).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-n\fR \fIdevice-path\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The path to a target device node for which properties are displayed. The
default path is that of the root node (equivalent to specifying \fB-n\fR
\fB/\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-q\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies quoted output mode, in which string properties are output
surrounded by double quotation marks (\fB"\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-v\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies verbose mode, in which the name of the property is output before
its value.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIproperty\fR.\|.\|.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Name of the property to be displayed.
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
