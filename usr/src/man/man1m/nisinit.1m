.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBnisinit\fR initializes a machine to be a NIS+ client or an NIS+ root
master server. It may be easier to use \fBnisclient\fR(1M) or
\fBnisserver\fR(1M) to accomplish this same task.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-r\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Initialize the machine to be a NIS+ root server. This option creates the
file \fB/var/nis/data/root.object\fR and initialize it to contain
information about this machine. It uses the \fBsysinfo\fR(2) system call to
retrieve the name of the default domain.
.sp
To initialize the machine as an NIS+ root server, it is advisable to use
the "\fB-r\fR" option of \fBnisserver\fR(1M), instead of using "\fBnisinit
-r\fR".
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-p\fB Y \|| D \|| N\fR \fIparent_domain host .\|.\|.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This option is used on a root server to initialize a
\fB/var/nis/data/parent.object\fR to make this domain a part of the
namespace above it. Only root servers can have parent objects. A parent
object describes the namespace ``above'' the NIS+ root. If this is an
isolated domain, this option should not be used. The argument to this option
tells the command what type of name server is serving the domain above the
NIS+ domain. When clients attempt to resolve a name that is outside of the
NIS+ namespace, this object is returned with the error \fBNIS_FOREIGNNS\fR
indicating that a name space boundary has been reached. It is up to the
client to continue the name resolution process.
.sp
The parameter \fIparent_domain\fR is the name of the parent domain in a
syntax that is native to that type of domain. The list of host names that
follow the domain parameter are the names of hosts that serve the parent
domain. If there is more than one server for a parent domain, the first host
specified should be the master server for that domain.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBY\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
Specifies that the parent directory is a NIS version 2 domain.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBD\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
Specifies that the parent directory is a DNS domain.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBN\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt
Specifies that the parent directory is another NIS+ domain. This option is
useful for connecting a pre-existing NIS+ subtree into the global
namespace.
.RE

Note that in the current implementation, the NIS+ clients do not take
advantage of the \fB-p\fR feature. Also, since the parent object is
currently not replicated on root replica servers, it is recommended that
this option not be used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-c\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Initializes the machine to be a NIS+ client. There are three initialization
options available: initialize by coldstart, initialize by hostname, and
initialize by broadcast. The most secure mechanism is to initialize from a
trusted coldstart file. The second option is to initialize using a hostname
that you specify as a trusted host. The third method is to initialize by
broadcast and it is the least secure method.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-C\fR \fIcoldstart\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Causes the file \fIcoldstart\fR to be used as a prototype coldstart file
when initializing a NIS+ client. This coldstart file can be copied from a
machine that is already a client of the NIS+ namespace. For maximum
security, an administrator can encrypt and encode (with \fBuuencode\fR(1C))
the coldstart file and mail it to an administrator bringing up a new
machine. The new administrator would then decode (with \fBuudecode\fR),
decrypt, and then use this file with the \fBnisinit\fR command to initialize
the machine as an NIS+ client. If the coldstart file is from another client
in the same domain, the \fBnisinit\fR command may be safely skipped and the
file copied into the \fB/var/nis\fR directory as
\fB/var/nis/NIS_COLD_START\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-H\fR \fIhostname\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Specifies that the host \fBhostname\fR should be contacted as a trusted
NIS+ server. The \fBnisinit\fR command will iterate over each transport in
the \fBNETPATH\fR environment variable and attempt to contact
\fBrpcbind\fR(1M) on that machine. This hostname \fImust\fR be reachable
from the client without the name service running. For \fBIP\fR networks this
means that there must be an entry in \fB/etc/hosts\fR for this host when
\fBnisinit\fR is invoked.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-B\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Specifies that the \fBnisinit\fR command should use an IP broadcast to
locate a NIS+ server on the local subnet. Any machine that is running the
NIS+ service may answer. No guarantees are made that the server that answers
is a server of the organization's namespace. If this option is used, it is
advisable to check with your system administrator that the server and domain
served are valid. The binding information can be dumped to the standard
output using the \fBnisshowcache\fR(1M) command.
.RE

Note that \fBnisinit\fR \fB-c\fR will just enable navigation of the NIS+
name space from this client. To make NIS+ your name service, modify the file
\fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR to reflect that. See \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4) for
more details.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-k\fR <\fIkey_domain\fR>\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This option specifies the domain where root's credentials are stored. If it
is not specified, then the system default domain is assumed. This domain
name is used to create the \fB/var/nis/NIS_COLD_START\fR file.
