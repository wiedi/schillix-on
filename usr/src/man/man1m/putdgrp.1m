.SH NAME
putdgrp \- edits device group table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBputdgrp\fR [\fB-d\fR] \fIdgroup\fR [\fIdevice\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBputdgrp\fR modifies the device group table. It performs two kinds of
modification. It can modify the table  by creating a new device group or
removing a device group. It can also change group definitions by  adding or
removing a device from the group definition.
.sp
.LP
When the command is invoked with only a \fIdgroup\fR specification, the
command adds the specified group name to the device group table if it does
not already exist. If the \fB-d\fR option is also used with only the
\fIdgroup\fR specification, the command deletes the group from the table.
.sp
.LP
When the command is invoked with both a \fIdgroup\fR and a \fIdevice\fR
specification, it adds the given device name(s) to the group definition.
When invoked with both arguments and the \fB-d\fR option, the command
deletes the device name(s) from the group definition.
.sp
.LP
When the command is invoked with both a \fIdgroup\fR and a \fIdevice\fR
specification and the device group does not exist, it creates the group and
adds the specified devices to that new group.
