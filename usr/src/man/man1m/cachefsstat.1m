.SH NAME
cachefsstat \- Cache File System statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/cachefsstat\fR [\fB-z\fR] [\fIpath\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcachefsstat\fR command displays statistical information about the cache file system mounted on \fIpath\fR. The statistical information includes cache hits and misses, consistency checking, and modification operations. If \fIpath\fR is not specified, all mounted cache file systems are used.
.sp
.LP
\fBcachefsstat\fR can also be used to reinitialize this information (see \fB-z\fR option).
.sp
.LP
The statistical information has the following format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
<\fIcache hit rate\fR>
<\fIconsistency checks\fR>
<\fImodifies\fR> 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp

where:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIhit rate\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
The percentage of cache hits over the total number of attempts, followed by the actual numbers of hits and misses.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIconsistency checks\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
The number of consistency checks performed, followed by the number that passed, and the number that failed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fImodifies\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
The number of modify operations, including writes, creates, etc.
.RE

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following option is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-z\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Zero (reinitialize) statistics. Execute \fBcachefsstat\fR \fB-z\fR before executing \fBcachefsstat\fR again to gather statistics on the cache performance. This option can only be use by the superuser. The statistics printed reflect those just before the statistics are reinitialized.

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBcachefsstat\fR when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte (2^31 bytes).
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUsing \fBcachefsstat\fR
.sp
.LP
The following example shows the \fBcachefsstat\fR command run on file system \fB/test\fR: 

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# cachefsstat /test
  /test
       cache hit rate:      100% (0 hits, 0 misses)
       consistency checks:    0  (0 pass, 0 fail)
       modifies:              0
garbage collection:           0
