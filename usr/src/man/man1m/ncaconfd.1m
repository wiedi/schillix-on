.TH ncaconfd 1M "12 Oct 2004" "SunOS 5.11" "System Administration Commands"
.SH NAME
ncaconfd \- Solaris Network Cache and Accelerator (NCA) configuration
daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/inet/ncaconfd\fR [\fB-al\fR ] \fIinterface1 \fR [\fIinterface2 ...\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Use the \fBncaconfd\fR utility to set up NCA on a system. At boot time, the
\fBncakmod\fR initialization script reads in \fBnca.if\fR(4) to determine on
which interface(s) NCA should run. \fBncaconfd\fR then sets up the
interface.
.sp
.LP
\fBncaconfd\fR also operates as a daemon if the \fBnca_active\fR key is set
to enabled in \fBncakmod.conf\fR(4) file. In this case, \fBncaconfd\fR will
continue as a daemon after all the NCA interfaces have been set up,
listening for routing changes. The changes are then passed to NCA to control
which interface NCA should use to make active outgoing TCP connnections.
