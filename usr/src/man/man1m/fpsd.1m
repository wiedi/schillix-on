.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBfpsd\fR is a user-level daemon that periodically runs non-intrusive
tests to validate proper functioning of FPU (Floating Point Unit) hardware
in the system. A fault management action is initiated by means of
\fBfmd\fR(1M), in case an error is detected by the test.
.SH EXIT STATUS

The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2

The \fBfpsd\fR service is managed by the service management facility,
\fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/system/fpsd:default
.fi
.in -2

You can use \fBsvccfg\fR(1M) to change the default \fBfpsd\fR behavior:

config/exclude_cpus      astring  comma delimited list of
                                   CPU IDs to be excluded
                                   from proactive testing.

Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or
requesting restart, can be performed using
.BR svcadm (1M).
The service's
status can be queried using the
.BR svcs (1)
command.
.sp
.LP
Disabling the service can increase system's vulnerability to silent data
corruption, if a fault were to develop in an FPU within the system.
