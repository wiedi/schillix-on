.SH NAME
ldap_cachemgr \- LDAP daemon to manage client configuration for LDAP based
Network Information Service lookups
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/ldap/ldap_cachemgr\fR [\fB-l\fR \fIlog-file\fR] [\fB-g\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B ldap_cachemgr
daemon is a process that provides an up-to-date
configuration cache for LDAP naming services. It is started during
multi-user boot.
.sp
.LP
The
.B ldap_cachemgr
utility provides caching for all parameters as
specified and used by the LDAP naming service clients. The
\fBldap_cachemgr\fR utility uses the cache files which are originally
created by executing the \fBldapclient\fR(1M) utility, as cold start files.
Updates to the cache files take place dynamically if profiles are used to
configure the client. See the
.B init
option to
.BR ldapclient (1M).
.sp
.LP
The
.B ldap_cachemgr
utility helps improve the performance of the
clients that are using LDAP as the Naming service repository. In order for
the LDAP naming services to function properly, the \fBldap_cachemgr\fR
daemon must be running.
.B ldap_cachemgr
also improves system security by
making the configuration files readable by superuser only.
.sp
.LP
The cache maintained by this daemon is shared by all the processes that
access LDAP Naming information. All processes access this cache through a
door call. On startup,
.B ldap_cachemgr
initializes the cache from the
cache files. See
.BR ldapclient (1M).
Thus, the cache survives machine
reboots.
.sp
.LP
The
.B ldap_cachemgr
daemon also acts as its own administration tool. If
an instance of
.B ldap_cachemgr
is already running, commands are passed
transparently to the running version.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
