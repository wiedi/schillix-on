.SH NAME
sndrsyncd \- Availability Suite Remote Mirror update resynchronization
daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/sndrsyncd\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsndrsyncd\fR daemon automates update resynchronization after a
network or machine failure and invokes Point-in-Time Copy copies when needed
to protect the data volumes being updated during a resynchronization.
.sp
.LP
The daemon is notified by the kernel when a network link being used by
Remote Mirror goes down and invokes the \fBsndradm\fR(1M) command with the
\fB-u\fR option to resynchronize all Remote Mirror sets which have autosync
switched on and are using the network link. See \fBsndradm\fR(1M) for
details on how to configure autosync for a Remote Mirror set.
.sp
.LP
The daemon is also notified when any Remote Mirror resynchronization starts
or completes. The daemon takes Point-in-Time Copy snapshots, if configured
in the Availability Suite configuration file. On a secondary server, the
daemon checks if a file system is currently mounted on the secondary volume
and informs the kernel not to allow the synchronization to start if the file
system is currently mounted.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Do not manually stop the sndrsyncd deamon. If you need to manually stop
sndrsyncd perform these steps. This stops both the \fBsndrd\fR and
\fBsndrsyncd\fR daemons.
