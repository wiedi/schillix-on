.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdevattr\fR displays the values for a device's attributes. The display can be presented in two formats. Used without the  \fB-v\fR option, only the attribute values are shown. Used with the  \fB-v\fR option, the attributes are shown in an  \fIattribute\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR format. When no attributes are given on the command line, all attributes for the  specified device are displayed in alphabetical order by attribute name. If attributes are given on the command line, only those attributes  are shown, displayed in command line order.
