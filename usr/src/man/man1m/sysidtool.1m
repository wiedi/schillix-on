.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBsysidtool\fR is a suite of programs that configure a new system, or one
that has been unconfigured with \fBsys-unconfig\fR(1M). The \fBsysidtool\fR
programs run automatically at system installation, or during the first boot
after a machine has been successfully unconfigured.
.sp
.LP
These programs have no effect except at such times, and should never be run
manually.
.sp
.LP
The
.B sysidtool
programs set up the appropriate information in the
machine's configuration files, in the kernel, and on the machine's network
interface. The following list shows the available commands and the
information for which each of the commands lists.

\fBsysidconfig\fR: host- or platform-specific configuration\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This command controls specification and execution of custom configuration
applications that can be specified for a particular host or a particular
platform. See \fBsysidconfig\fR(1M).
.RE

.sp
.LP
The
.B sysidtool
programs attempt to obtain system configuration
information from various name service databases, for example, NIS, or from
the
.BR sysidcfg (4)
file, and you are prompted to provide the information
if it cannot be found. However, you can avoid one or more of the prompts by
preconfiguring the appropriate configuration information in the name service
databases or in the
.BR sysidcfg (4)
file.
.sp
.LP
To preconfigure the information in the name service databases, you must use
the name service commands or the Solstice AdminSuite tools. See\fR  for
more details about how to preconfigure the system configuration
information.
.sp
.LP
The machine's configuration information is set up in its
.B /etc
and
\fB/var\fR files.
.sp
.LP
If a system has more than one network interface, you can use
\fBsysidtool\fR to configure all interfaces on the system.
.sp
.LP
You cannot use the name service databases or the
.BR sysidcfg (4)
file to
suppress the Power Management configuration prompt. However, you can
suppress it by creating either the
.B /autoshutdown
or
\fB/noautoshutdown\fR file before installation reboot. Accordingly, the
auto-shutdown feature is silently configured. The
.B /autoshutdown
or
\fB/noautoshutdown\fR files are removed by \fBsysidpm\fR before it exits.
.sp
.LP
\fBsysidnfs4\fR installs the \fB/etc/.NFS4inst_state.domain\fR file upon
the successful configuration of the NFSv4 domain name. If this file is
present during system reboot, the \fBsysidnfs4\fR program is run but no
prompts are displayed. The suppression of prompts is intended for system
upgrades, in which a system configuration typically stays unchanged. The
stability level of this interface is obsolete
.sp
.LP
\fBsysidkbd\fR prompts for the keyboards with \fBzero-bCountryCode\fR and
then sets the keyboard layout string in the \fB/etc/default/kbd\fR file. If
the
.B sysidkbd
gets the valid keyboard layout string, the string will be
set into the entry "LAYOUT=" in the file.
