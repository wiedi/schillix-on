.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B cfgadm
command provides configuration administration operations on
dynamically reconfigurable hardware resources. These operations include
displaying status,
.RB ( -l ),
initiating testing,
.RB ( -t ),
invoking
configuration state changes,
.RB ( -c ),
invoking hardware specific functions,
(\fB-x\fR), and obtaining configuration administration help messages
(\fB-h\fR). Configuration administration is performed at \fBattachment
points\fR, which are places where system software supports dynamic
reconfiguration of hardware resources during continued operation of Solaris.
.sp
.LP
Configuration administration makes a distinction between hardware resources
that are physically present in the machine and hardware resources that are
configured and visible to Solaris. The nature of configuration administration
functions are hardware specific, and are performed by calling hardware specific
libraries.
.sp
.LP
Configuration administration operates on an
.BR "attachment point" .
Hardware
resources located at attachment points can or can not be physically replaceable
during system operation, but are dynamically reconfigurable by way of the
configuration administration interfaces.
.sp
.LP
An attachment point defines two unique elements, which are distinct from the
hardware resources that exist beyond the attachment point. The two elements of
an attachment point are a
.B receptacle
and an
.BR occupant .
Physical
insertion or removal of hardware resources occurs at attachment points and
results in a receptacle gaining or losing an occupant. Configuration
administration supports the physical insertion and removal operations as well
as other configuration administration functions at an attachment point.
.sp
.LP
Attachment points have associated state and condition information. The
configuration administration interfaces provide control for transitioning
attachment point states. A receptacle can exist in one of three states:
.BR empty ,
.B disconnected
or
.BR connected ,
while an occupant can exist
in one of two states: \fBconfigured\fR or \fBunconfigured\fR.
.sp
.LP
A receptacle can provide the
.B empty
state, which is the normal state of a
receptacle when the attachment point has no occupants. A receptacle can also
provide the
.B disconnected
state if it has the capability of isolating its
occupants from normal system access. Typically this state is used for various
hardware specific testing prior to bringing the occupant's resources into full
use by the system, or as a step in preparing an occupant for physical removal
or reconfiguration. A receptacle in the disconnected state isolates its
occupant from the system as much as its hardware allows, but can provide access
for testing and setup. A receptacle must provide the
.B connected
state,
which allows normal access to hardware resources contained on any occupants.
The connected state is the normal state of a receptacle that contains an
occupant and that is not currently undergoing configuration administration
operations.
.sp
.LP
The hardware resources contained on an occupant in the \fBunconfigured\fR
state are not represented by normal Solaris data structures and are thus not
available for use by Solaris. Operations allowed on an unconfigured occupant
are limited to configuration administration operations. The hardware resources
of an occupant in the
.B configured
state are represented by normal Solaris
data structures and thus some or all of those hardware resources can be in use
by Solaris. All occupants provide both the
.B configured
and
.B unconfigured
states,
.sp
.LP
An attachment point can be in one of five conditions:
.BR unknown ,
.BR ok ,
.BR failing ,
.BR failed ,
or
.BR unusable .
An attachment point can enter
the system in any condition depending upon results of power-on tests and
non-volatile record keeping.
.sp
.LP
An attachment point with an occupant in the
.B configured
state is in one
of four conditions:
.BR unknown ,
.BR ok ,
.BR failing ,
or
.BR failed .
If
the condition is not \fBfailing\fR or \fBfailed\fR an attachment point can
change to
.B failing
during the course of operation if a hardware dependent
recoverable error threshold is exceeded. If the condition is not \fBfailed\fR
an attachment point can change to
.B failed
during operation as a result of
an unrecoverable error.
.sp
.LP
An attachment point with an occupant in the
.B unconfigured
state can be in
any of the defined conditions. The condition of an attachment point with an
.B unconfigured
occupant can decay from
.B ok
to
.B unknown
after a
machine dependent time threshold. Initiating a test function changes the
attachment point's condition to
.BR ok ,
.B failing
or \fBfailed\fR
depending on the outcome of the test. An attachment point that does not provide
a test function can leave the attachment point in the
.B unknown
condition.
If a test is interrupted, the attachment point's condition can be set to the
previous condition,
.B unknown
or
.BR failed .
An attachment point in the
.BR unknown ,
.BR ok ,
.BR failing ,
or
.B failed
conditions can be
re-tested.
.sp
.LP
An attachment point can exist in the
.B unusable
condition for a variety of
reasons, such as inadequate power or cooling for the receptacle, an occupant
that is unidentifiable, unsupported, incorrectly configured, etc. An attachment
point in the
.B unusable
condition can never be used by the system. It
typically remains in this condition until the physical cause is remedied.
.sp
.LP
An attachment point also maintains busy information that indicates when a
state change is in progress or the condition is being reevaluated.
.sp
.LP
Attachment points are referred to using hardware specific identifiers
(\fIap_id\fRs) that are related to the type and location of the attachment
points in the system device hierarchy. An
.I ap_id
can not be ambiguous, it
must identify a single attachment point. Two types of \fIap_id\fR
specifications are supported: physical and logical. A physical \fIap_id\fR
contains a fully specified pathname, while a logical
.I ap_id
contains a
shorthand notation that identifies an attachment point in a more user-friendly
way.
.sp
.LP
For example, an attachment point representing a system's backplane slot number
.B 7
could have a physical
.I ap_id
of
.B /devices/central/fhc/sysctrl:slot7
while the logical
.I ap_id
could be
.BR system:slot7 .
Another example, the third receptacle on the second \fBPCI
I/O\fR bus on a system could have a logical \fIap_id\fR of
.BR pci2:plug3 .
.sp
.LP
Attachment points may also be created dynamically. A dynamic attachment point
is named relative to a base attachment point which is present in the system.
\fBap_id\fRs for dynamic attachment points consist of a base component followed
by two colons (\fB::\fR) and a dynamic component. The base component is the
base attachment point
.BR ap_id .
The dynamic component is hardware specific
and generated by the corresponding hardware specific library.
.sp
.LP
For example, consider a base attachment point, which represents a \fBSCSI
HBA\fR, with the physical \fBap_id\fR
.B /devices/sbus@1f,0/SUNW,fas@e,8800000:scsi
and logical
.B "ap_id c0"
\&. A
disk attached to this
.B "SCSI HBA"
could be represented by a dynamic
attachment point with logical
.B "ap_id c0::dsk/c0t0d0"
where
.BR c0
is the base component and
.B dsk/c0t0d0
is the hardware specific dynamic
component. Similarly the physical
.B ap_id
for this dynamic attachment point
would be: \fB/devices/sbus@1f,0/SUNW,fas@e,8800000:scsi::dsk/c0t0d0\fR
.sp
.LP
An
.I ap_type
is a partial form of a logical
.B ap_id
that can be
ambiguous and not specify a particular attachment point. An
.I ap_type
is a
substring of the portion of the logical
.B ap_id
up to but not including the
colon (\fB:\fR) separator. For example, an \fIap_type\fR of
.B pci
would
show all attachment points whose logical
.IR ap_id "s begin with"
.BR pci .
.sp
.LP
The use of
.I ap_types
is discouraged. The new select sub-option to the
.B -s
option provides a more general and flexible mechanism for selecting
attachment points. See
.BR OPTIONS .
.sp
.LP
The
.B cfgadm
command interacts primarily with hardware dependent functions
contained in hardware specific libraries and thus its behavior is hardware
dependent.
.sp
.LP
For each configuration administration operation a service interruption can be
required. Should the completion of the function requested require a noticeable
service interruption to interactive users, a prompt is output on the standard
error output for confirmation on the standard input before the function is
started. Confirmation can be overridden using the
.B -y
or
.B -n
options
to always answer yes or no respectively. Hardware specific options, such as
test level, are supplied as sub-options using the
.B -o
option.
.sp
.LP
Operations that change the state of the system configuration are audited by
the system log daemon
.BR syslogd (1M).
.sp
.LP
The arguments for this command conform to the
.BR getopt "(3C) and"
.BR getsubopt (3C)
syntax convention.

.RE

State transition functions can fail due to the condition of the attachment
point or other hardware dependent considerations. All state change
\fIfunction\fRs in the direction of adding resources, \fB(insert,\fR
.B connect
and
.B configure)
are passed onto the hardware specific
library when the attachment point is in the
.B ok
or
.BR unknown
condition. All other conditions require the use of the force option to allow
these \fIfunction\fRs to be passed on to the hardware specific library.
Attachment point condition does not prevent a hardware specific library being
called for related to the removal (\fBremove, disconnect\fR and
.BR unconfigure ),
of hardware resources from the system. Hardware specific
libraries can reject state change \fIfunction\fRs if the attachment point is in
the
.B unknown
condition.
.sp
The condition of an attachment point is not necessarily changed by the state
change functions, however errors during state change operations can change the
attachment point condition. An attempt to override a condition and force a
state change that would otherwise fail can be made by specifying the force
option (\fB-f\fR). Hardware specific safety and integrity checks can prevent
the force option from having any effect.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.B -f
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Forces the specified action to occur. Typically, this is a hardware dependent
override of a safety feature. Forcing a state change operation can allow use of
the hardware resources of occupant that is not in the
.B ok

the data that is displayed (\fBcols=\fIfield_spec\fR and
\fBcols2=\fIfield_spec\fR), the column delimiter (\fBdelim=\fIstring\fR)
and whether to suppress column headings
.RB ( noheadings ).
.sp
When the
.B select
sub-option is specified, only attachment points which
match the specified criteria will be listed. The
.B select
sub-option has
the following syntax:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
cfgadm \fB-s\fR select=attr1(value1):attr2(value2).\|.\|.
.fi
.in -2
.sp

where an
.I attr
is one of
.BR ap_id ,
.B class
or
.BR type .
.B ap_id
refers to the logical
.I ap_id
field,
.B class
refers to
attachment point class and
.B type
refers to the type field.
.IR value1 ,
.IR value2 ,
etc. are the corresponding values to be matched. The type of
match can be specified by the
.B match
sub-option as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
cfgadm \fB-s\fR match=\fImatch_type\fR,select=attr1(value1).\|.\|.
.fi
.in -2
.sp

where
.I match_type
can be either
.B exact
or
.BR partial .
The default
value is
.BR exact .
.sp
Arguments to the
.B select
sub-option can be quoted to protect them from
the shell.
.sp
A \fIfield_spec\fR is one or more \fIdata-field\fRs concatenated using colon
(\fB:\fR), as in \fIdata-field\fR:\fIdata-field\fR:\fIdata-field\fR. A
.I data-field
is one of
.BR ap_id ,
.BR physid ,
.BR r_state ,
.BR o_state ,
.BR condition ,
.BR type ,
.BR busy ,
.BR status_time ,
.BR status_time_p ,
.BR class ,
and
.BR info .
The
.B ap_id
field output
is the logical name for the attachment point, while the
.B physid
field
contains the physical name. The
.B r_state
field can be
.BR empty ,
.B disconnected
or
.BR connected .
The
.B o_state
field can be
.B configured
or
.BR unconfigured .
The
.B busy
field can be either
.B y
if the attachment point is busy, or
.B n
if it is not. The
.B type
and \fBinfo\fR fields are hardware specific. The \fBstatus_time\fR
field provides the time at which either the
.BR r_state ,
.BR o_state ,
or
condition of the attachment point last changed. The
.B status_time_p
field
is a parsable version of the
.B status_time
field. If an attachment point
has an associated class, the
.B class
field lists the class name. If an
attachment point does not have an associated class, the
.B class
field lists
.BR none .
.sp
The order of the fields in \fIfield_spec\fR is significant: For the \fBsort\fR
sub-option, the first field given is the primary sort key. For the \fBcols\fR
and
.B cols2
sub-options, the fields are printed in the order requested. The
order of sorting on a
.I data-field
can be reversed by placing a minus
(\fB\(mi\fR) before the \fIdata-field\fR name within the \fIfield_sec\fR for
the
.B sort
sub-option. The default value for
.B sort
is
.BR ap_id .
The
defaults values for
.B cols
and
.B cols2
depend on whether the
.BR -v
option is given: Without it
.B cols
is
.BR ap_id:r_state:o_state:condition
and
.B cols2
is not set. With
.B "-v cols"
is
.B ap_id:r_state:o_state:condition:info
and
.B cols2
is
.BR status_time:type:busy:physid: .
The default value for
.B delim
is a
single space. The value of
.B delim
can be a string of arbitrary length. The
delimiter cannot include comma (\fB,\fR) character, see
.BR getsubopt (3C).
These listing options can be used to create parsable output. See

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Hardware resources enter the unconfigured pool in a hardware specific manner.
This can occur at various times such as: system initialization or as a result
of an unconfigure operation. An occupant that is in the \fBunconfigured\fR
state is not available for use by the system until specific intervention
occurs. This intervention can be manifested as an operator initiated command or
it can be by way of an automatic configuring mechanism.
.sp
.LP
The listing option of the
.B cfgadm
command can be used to provide parsable
input for another command, for example within a shell script. For parsable
output, the
.B -s
option must be used to select the fields required. The
.B -s
option can also be used to suppress the column headings. The following
fields always produce parsable output:
.BR ap_id ,
.BR physid ,
.BR r_state ,
.BR o_state ,
.BR condition ,
.BR "busy status_time_p" ,
.BR class ,
and
.BR type .
Parsable output never has white-space characters
embedded in the field value.
.sp
.LP
The following shell script fragment finds the first good \fBunconfigured\fR
occupant of type
.BR CPU.

giving the year, month, day, hour, minute and second in a
form suitable for string comparison.
