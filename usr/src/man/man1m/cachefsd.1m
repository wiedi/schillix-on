.SH NAME
cachefsd \- CacheFS daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/fs/cachefs/cachefsd\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcachefsd\fR server implements features of the cache filesystem
(CacheFS). It is invoked at boot time and run if the \fB/\fR (root) and
\fB/usr\fR filesystems are being cached. If \fB/usr\fR is being cached,
\fBcachefsd\fR is invoked by \fBinetd\fR(1M) from \fBinetd.conf\fR(4). At
run time, \fBcachefsd\fR is invoked by the \fBinetd\fR mechanism in response
to an RPC request from a user command such as \fBmount_cachefs\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
The \fBcachefsd\fR server supports the "disconnected mode" of CacheFS. In
this mode, a user can continue to read and, depending on the option
selected, write to files in a cached filesystem when the NFS server for the
cached files is not available.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcachefsd\fR daemon performs the following functions in support of
the CacheFS:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Implements the connection policy. The daemon determines whether the NFS
server backing the cache is connected or disconnected from the cache, or is
in transition from the connected or disconnected states.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Implements "log rolling," wherein the daemon monitors a disconnected NFS
server for reconnection. After such a server returns to a connected state,
\fBcachefsd\fR rolls any local changes to cached files (kept in a log) back
to the server.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Manages "packing," wherein \fBcachefsd\fR makes a best effort to ensure
that files in a user-specified list are available in the cache in
disconnected mode.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Supports user interfaces by supplying statistics, reporting conflicts
between the cache and the back filesystem, and supporting a list of files
for packing.
.RE
.sp
.LP
The running of \fBcachefsd\fR is required for the disconnected mode of
CacheFS.
