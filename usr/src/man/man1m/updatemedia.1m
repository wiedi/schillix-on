.SH NAME
updatemedia \- modify Solaris media with patches and packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/updatemedia\fR  \fB-d\fR \fImedia-root\fR [\fB-v\fR] [\fB-o\fR \fIiso\fR] [\fB-l\fR \fIlabel\fR]
     \fIpkg_or_patch\fR [\fIpkg_or_patch\fR .\|.\|.]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBupdatemedia\fR utility takes a list of patches and packages as input
and updates the install miniroot in \fImedia-root\fR (the root directory of
an on-disk image of a Solaris installation media) to include the specified
patches and packages. These patches and packages are also placed in a
subdirectory called \fBDU\fR under the Solaris install image. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fImedia-root\fR/Solaris_10/DU
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
When booting a system from the updated media, the patches and packages will
be part of the booted Solaris image. They will also be applied to the target
system being installed at the end of the installation process.
.sp
.LP
If \fB-o\fR is specified, a bootable ISO image is created in the file
\fBmedia.iso\fR that contains the Solaris install media. The ISO image can
then be burned onto a CD/DVD with utilities such as \fBcdrw\fR(1) or
\fBcdrecord(1)\fR. (The latter is not a SunOS man page.)
