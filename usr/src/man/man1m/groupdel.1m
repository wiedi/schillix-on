.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBgroupdel\fR utility only deletes a group definition that is in the local \fB/etc/group\fR file. If a network nameservice such as \fBNIS\fR or \fBNIS+\fR is being used to supplement the local \fB/etc/group\fR file with additional entries, \fBgroupdel\fR cannot change information supplied by the network nameservice.
.sp
.LP
\fBgroupdel\fR fails if a group entry (a single line in \fB/etc/group\fR) exceeds 2047 characters.
