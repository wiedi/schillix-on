.LP
\fBquota\fR displays quotas for NFS mounted UFS- or ZFS-based file systems
if the
.B rquotad
daemon is running. See
.BR rquotad (1M).
In a
.BR zones (5)
environment,
.B quota
displays quotas only for the zone in
which it is invoked.
.sp
.LP
\fBquota\fR can display entries for the same file system multiple times for
multiple mount points. For example,
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBquota -v user1\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
might display identical quota information for
.B user1
at the mount
points
.BR /home/user1 ,
.BR /home/user2 ,
and
.BR /home/user ,
if all
three mount points are mounted from the same file system with quotas turned
on.
