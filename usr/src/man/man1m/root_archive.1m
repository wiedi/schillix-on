.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B root_archive
utility is used to manipulate boot archives and the
bootable miniroot(s) in a Solaris install image. The utility can pack and
unpack boot archives and image miniroots. Both \fBufs\fR and \fBhsfs\fR
(\fBiso9660\fR) format archives can be unpacked, although only \fBufs\fR
format is generated when packing.
.sp
.LP
For normal, boot-related system administration,
.BR bootadm (1M)
is
recommended. \fBroot_archive\fR's primary purpose is to enable OEMs to add
or update a driver or other component on the Solaris install media.
.sp
.LP
A miniroot and a boot archive is closely associated with the release it is
intended to boot. To ensure that the tools and system services used to
construct the miniroot match, miniroot manipulation must be performed only
on a system running the same release for which the miniroot is intended to
install.
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.sp
.LP
The
.B root_archive
command has the following subcommands:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B pack
.I archive root
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt
Pack the contents of the root directory into the boot archive
.IR archive .
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B unpack
.I archive root
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Unpack the contents of the boot archive named
.I archive
to the
directory named
.IR root .
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B packmedia
.I solaris_image root
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Create and pack the miniroot(s) in

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B unpackmedia
.I solaris_image root
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Unpack the contents of the miniroot(s) in
.I solaris_image
to the
directory named
.IR root .
.RE

.sp
.LP
The contents of a miniroot are constructed to need the requirements of the
release. When unpacking a miniroot, all the contents of the miniroot(s) are
unpacked. When packing a miniroot, the source directory must contain all the
necessary components with which to construct a miniroot. In general, this
can only be achieved by first unpacking an existing miniroot.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
.B Example 1
Unpacking the Miniroots in a Solaris x86 Install Image
.sp
.LP
The following command unpacks the miniroots in a Solaris image to the root
directory in
.BR /export/release/latest .

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBroot_archive unpackmedia \e\fR
\fB/export/nv/solarisdvd.nvx_dvd/latest /export/release/latest/root\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In the preceding,
.B /export/nv/solarisdvd.nvx_dvd/latest
represents a
path to a Solaris x86 install image and
.B /export/release/latest/root
is
a directory that will be purged or created, as necessary.

.LP
.B Example 2

from the contents of the directory

.in +2
.nf
# \fBroot_archive packmedia \e\fR
\fB/export/nv/solarisdvd.nvx_dvd/latest /export/release/latest/root\fR
