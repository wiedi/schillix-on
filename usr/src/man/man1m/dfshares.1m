.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdfshares\fR provides information about resources available to the host
through a distributed file system of type \fIFSType\fR.
\fIspecific_options\fR as well as the semantics of \fIserver\fR are specific
to particular distributed file systems.
.sp
.LP
If \fBdfshares\fR is entered without arguments, all resources  currently
shared on the local system are displayed, regardless  of file system type.
.sp
.LP
The output of \fBdfshares\fR consists of an optional header line
(suppressed with the \fB-h\fR flag) followed by a list of lines containing
whitespace-separated fields.  For each resource, the fields are:
.sp
.in +2
