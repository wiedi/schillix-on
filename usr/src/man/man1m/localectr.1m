.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlocalectr\fR utility allows new locales to be customized and built. The
output of \fBlocalectr\fR is an installable package containing the compiled
shared object binary which contains the locale data information as well as a
number of other supporting files that are required to have a fully working
locale on the system.
.sp
.LP
Once generated, the package can be added to the system by using the
\fBpkgadd\fR(1M) command and removed with \fBpkgrm\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
Depending on your default system login, you might have to reset your user
environment after you add a locale. If \fBdtlogin(1X)\fR (for the CDE user
environment) is the default system login, you need to restart \fBdtlogin\fR. No
action is required if \fBgdm(1)\fR (for the Gnome user environment) is the
default login.
.sp
.LP
There are two interfaces to \fBlocalectr\fR, command line (CLI) and graphical
user interface (GUI). To customize the locale data, you must use the GUI. To
create locales with standard locale data according to Unicode's Common Locale
Data Repository (CLDR), the CLI is sufficient.
.sp
.LP
With the CLI it is also possible to generate several locales in a single step,
with a separate package being generated for each locale. With the GUI, a single
locale is processed at a time.
.sp
.LP
To launch the GUI, run the \fBlocalectr\fR command with no options. To run
from the CLI, use the appropriate options as described below.
.sp
.LP
\fBlocalectr\fR uses the \fBlocaledef\fR(1) utility to build the locale data
binary shared object. Therefore, access to a C compiler is required in order to
run \fBlocalectr\fR successfully, as this is also required by
\fBlocaledef\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBlocalectr\fR is mainly concerned with locale data. However, in order to
create a fully working locale on the system with \fBlocalectr\fR, many
features, such as fonts, translations and input methods, are also required.
Depending on what locales are already installed on the system, the relevant
features might or might not be present on the system. If they are not present,
then \fBlocaleadm\fR(1M) should be used to add the relevant packages before
adding packages created by \fBlocalectr\fR. \fBlocalectr\fR bundles locale data
for the latest set of locales available in Unicode's CLDR. A user can also
create a locale not available in CLDR by supplying her own data in the
\fBlocalectr\fR GUI.

user's \fBPATH\fR.

Specify a comma-separated  list of locale(s) to generate. Locale names are in
the form: \fIlocale\fR.\fIcodeset\fR@\fIvariant\fR, where \fIcodeset\fR and
\fIvariant\fR are optional. The default and only allowed \fIcodeset\fR is
\fBUTF-8\fR. The default \fIvariant\fR is \fBlocalectr\fR.

Queries \fBlocalectr\fR for a complete list of locales for which locale data
is defined in \fBlocalectr\fR. When \fBlocalectr\fR is run from the CLI, the
locale(s) specified with the \fB-l\fR option must be on this list in order for
an installable locale package to be generated.

Locale Data
.sp
.LP
The following example generates a package in the specified destination
directory, which can be used to install the Afrikaans (\fBaf_ZA.UTF-8\fR)
locale on the system. The package name is composed of a prefix followed by the
hyphen separated ISO-639 language code, the ISO-3166 country code, the locale
encoding and an optional user-defined tag. The resulting package can then be
added to the system using \fBpkgadd\fR(1M).
