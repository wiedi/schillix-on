.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfsck\fR utility audits and interactively repairs inconsistent
conditions on file systems. A file system to be checked may be specified by
giving the name of the block or character
.I special
device or by giving
the name of its mount point if a matching entry exists in
.BR /etc/vfstab .
.sp
.LP
The
.I special
parameter represents the character special device, for
example,
.BR /dev/rdsk/c1t0d0s7 ,
on which the file system resides. The
character special device, not the block special device should be used. The
\fBfsck\fR utility will not work if the block device is mounted, unless the
file system is error-locked.
.sp
.LP
If no
.I special
device is specified, all \fBufs\fR file systems
specified in the \fBvfstab\fR with a \fBfsckdev\fR entry will be checked. If
the
.B -p
(``preen'') option is specified, \fBufs\fR file systems with an
\fBfsckpass\fR number greater than \fB1\fR are checked in parallel. See
.BR fsck (1M).
.sp
.LP
In the case of correcting serious inconsistencies, by default, \fBfsck\fR
asks for confirmation before making a repair and waits for the operator to
respond either
.B yes
or
.BR no .
If the operator does not have write
permission on the file system, \fBfsck\fR will default to a
.B -n
(no
corrections) action. See \fBfsck\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
Repairing some file system inconsistencies can result in loss of data. The
amount and severity of data loss can be determined from the diagnostic
output.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfsck\fR utility automatically corrects innocuous inconsistencies
such as unreferenced inodes, too-large link counts in inodes, missing blocks
in the free list, blocks appearing in the free list and also in files, or
incorrect counts in the super block. It displays a message for each
inconsistency corrected that identifies the nature of the correction on the
file system which took place. After successfully correcting a file system,
\fBfsck\fR prints the number of files on that file system, the number of
used and free blocks, and the percentage of fragmentation.

.sp
.LP
Orphaned files and directories (allocated but unreferenced) are, with the
operator's concurrence, reconnected by placing them in the \fBlost+found\fR
directory. The name assigned is the inode number. If the \fBlost+found\fR
directory does not exist, it is created. If there is insufficient space in
the \fBlost+found\fR directory, its size is increased.
.sp
.LP
An attempt to mount a \fBufs\fR file system with the \fB-o
nolargefiles\fR option will fail if the file system has ever contained a
large file (a file whose size is greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte). Invoking
\fBfsck\fR resets the file system state if no large files are present in the
file system. A successful mount of the file system after invoking \fBfsck\fR
indicates the absence of large files in the file system. An unsuccessful
mount attempt indicates the presence of at least one large file. See
.BR mount_ufs (1M).
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The
.I generic-options
consist of the following options:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -m
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
Check but do not repair. This option checks that the file system is
suitable for mounting, returning the appropriate exit status. If the file
system is ready for mounting, \fBfsck\fR displays a message such as:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
The operating system buffers file system data. Running \fBfsck\fR on a
mounted file system can cause the operating system's buffers to become out
of date with respect to the disk. For this reason, the file system should be
\fIunmounted\fR when \fBfsck\fR is used. If this is not possible, care
should be taken that the system is quiescent and that it is rebooted
immediately after \fBfsck\fR is run. Quite often, however, this will not be
sufficient. A panic will probably occur if running \fBfsck\fR on a file
system modifies the file system.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
It is usually faster to check the character special device than the block
special device.
.sp
.LP
Running \fBfsck\fR on file systems larger than 2 Gb fails if the user
chooses to use the block interface to the device:

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBfsck /dev/dsk/c?t?d?s?\fR
