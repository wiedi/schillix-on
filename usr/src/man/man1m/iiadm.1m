.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Point-in-Time Copy software is a point-in-time snapshot feature of the
Solaris operating system.
.sp
.LP
A Point-in-Time Copy snapshot is an instantly-available, time-fixed,
replicated view of a momentarily quiesced volume. Once a snapshot is taken,
Point-in-Time Copy software allows immediate read/write access to both the
master and shadow volume data.
.sp
.LP
Point-in-Time Copy software tracks the differences between the master and
shadow volumes (caused by writes) from the moment that the snapshot was
established. This capability allows applications accessing the master
volume's data to move forward in time independently of applications
accessing the shadow volume's data, and vice-versa.
.sp
.LP
The Point-in-Time Copy software's tracking of differences between the
master and shadow volumes facilitates a fast resynchronization or a full
copy at a later time. The volume resynchronization can occur from either
shadow to master or master to shadow.
.sp
.LP
Instantly after the point-in-time is (re-)established (either when the CLI
prompt returns or the next shell script command is read), the master volume
can be remounted or the applications using them can be resumed. Also, the
shadow volume can be mounted and immediately accessed.
.sp
.LP
The
.B iiadm
command line utility performs only one action per command
invocation. Because of this, you cannot combine multiple options, except in
combination with the following overall command modifiers:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If no action item is entered,
.B iiadm
displays the list of
Point-in-Time Copy sets (non-suspended) currently configured. If more than
one action item, or an incorrectly specified action item is entered,
\fBiiadm\fR displays the specific error message to stderr, followed by a
brief usage summary.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
For the Point-in-Time Copy options ENABLE
.RB ( -e ),
COPY (\fB-c\fR) and
UPDATE
.RB ( -u ),
there are two associated shadow volume selection
qualifiers,
.BR {ind|dep} ,
that are used to specify the type of
Point-in-Time Copy volume set to create.
.RE
.sp
.LP
An independent (\fBind\fR) snapshot causes Point-in-Time Copy software to
perform a full volume copy operation from the master to the shadow. When the
copy completes, the shadow volume data is identical to the master volume
data at the moment that it was established. Create an independent shadow if
you require two physical copies of the data. An independent shadow volume
must be the same size or greater than the size of the master volume. Sun
recommends that the master and shadow volumes be the same size for
environments where resynchronization from shadow to master is a
consideration.
.sp
.LP
A dependent (\fBdep\fR) snapshot causes Point-in-Time Copy software not to
perform a full volume copy. The resulting shadow volume relies on the master
volume for all unmodified data blocks, which are not copied until requested.
Create a dependent shadow when you do not require two physical copies of the
data. A dependent shadow volume can be either the same size or smaller than
the master volume. A smaller shadow volume is called a \fBCompact Dependent
Shadow Volume\fR, and is typically used when the amount of change that
occurs to a Point-in-Time Copy volume set is small compared to the entire
size of the master volume.
.sp
.LP
The following syntax allows you to create an exportable independent shadow
volume in a Sun Cluster environment:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# iiadm -ne ind master shadow bitmap
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
An issue arises when using a Compact Dependent Shadow Volume in that its
size is established at the time that the Point-in-Time Copy volume set is
enabled. If the amount of change to the entire volume set over the duration
of its usage exceeds the space allocated for the shadow volume, the shadow
volume is marked as out of space. It is possible to read from the shadow
volume even after it is out of space, until a portion of the data for which
there was no room is requested. Once that happens, the read fails and the
shadow volume is marked offline.
.sp
.LP
To address this issue, Point-in-Time Copy supports the ability to associate
an \fBoverflow\fR volume to an existing Point-in-Time Copy dependent volume
set. Thus, if the size of the Compact Dependent Shadow Volume is too small,
or an unscheduled amount of change occurs to the volume set, changed data
can be redirected to the associated overflow volume. To facilitate efficient
usage of this overflow volume, it can be associated with multiple
Point-in-Time Copy volume sets on an as-needed basis.
.SS "Considerations"
.sp
.LP
Prior to invoking an Point-in-Time Copy
.BR enable ,
\fBcopy\fR or
\fBupdate\fR operation, Point-in-Time Copy assures that the shadow volume is
not mounted, to prevent a file system panic from occurring. Also, it is
suggested that you either unmount or suspend (quiesce) all applications
using the master volume, for only the instant when the point-in-time
snapshot is taken. This assures that an atomically consistent point-in-time
snapshot is taken.
.sp
.LP
It is suggested that, if the master volume was suspended rather than
unmounted, the new point-in-time shadow volume's integrity be validated
using volume validation utilities, such as \fBfsck\fR(1M). The reason is
that Point-in-Time Copy has made a point-in-time copy of a \fBmounted\fR
master volume to an
.B unmounted
shadow volume. During the mounting of
the shadow volume, the file system detects that it is in the \fBmounted\fR
state. Typically this state occurs only when a system crashes, so the file
system attempts to validate the integrity of the volume assuming a system
failure occurred, not an Point-in-Time Copy.
.SS "ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS"
.sp
.LP
The
.B ii_bitmap
variable in the \fB/usr/kernel/drv/ii.conf\fR
configuration file determines the bitmap volume operational semantics as
follows:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B 0
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Indicates that the bitmap is maintained in memory only or resume
operation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B 1
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Indicates that the bitmap is maintained in memory and on disk. This is the
default value.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If a system failure occurrs while using
.BR ii_bitmap=0 ,
the shadow
volume might be inconsistent and fast resynchronization would not be
possible.
.sp
.LP
If Point-in-Time Copy is used in conjunction with the Network Storage
component Remote Mirror or in a Sun Cluster, set
.BR ii_bitmap=1 .
.sp
.LP
The
.B ii_debug
variable in the \fB/usr/kernel/drv/ii.conf\fR
configuration file determines the amount of information logging that is
output to the system console
.B /dev/console
during Point-in-Time Copy
processing.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B 0
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Indicates that no logging is sent to the system console.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B 1
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Indicates that informational logging is sent to the system console.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The
.B iiadm
utility supports the following options.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-e{ind|dep}\fR \fImaster_vol shadow_vol bitmap_vol\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enable Point-in-Time Copy for the specified master, shadow, and bitmap
volumes.
.sp
The enable shadow set processing assures that the specified volumes are
accessible, that the
.I shadow_vol
is not mounted, and that the
\fIbitmap_vol\fR is correctly sized for the type of shadow set being
created. Additionally, it assures that the volumes are under control of the
SV driver ( if they are not, it puts them there), initializes the bitmap
volume, and, if the volume set is an independent shadow set, a full copy
operation is initiated.
.sp
On a successful enable, Point-in-Time Copy stores the specified
.IR master_vol ,
\fIshadow_vol\fR and \fIbitmap_vol\fR names, plus the
enabling type (\fBind\fR or
.BR dep ),
into the Point-in-Time Copy
configuration store. The configuration store contains all currently
configured Point-in-Time Copy Volume Sets and their associated configuration
attributes. (See discussion above on independent and dependent shadow volume
semantics.)
.sp
\fImaster_vol\fR is the volume from which a point-in-time snapshot is
made.
.sp
\fIshadow_vol\fR is the volume that contains the point-in-time snapshot.
.sp
\fIbitmap_vol\fR is used for tracking differences between the shadow and
master volumes. When Point-in-Time Copy shadow operations are suspended or
resumed, the bitmap volume (maintained in kernel memory) can be stored in or
retrieved from permanent storage. The storage associated with the bitmap
volume should be as redundant as that of the shadow volume storage.
.sp
The
.I shadow_vol
name is the name that the Point-in-Time Copy Shadow
Set is known by for all
.B iiadm
options requiring specification of a
\fIvolume_set\fR name.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-d\fR \fIvolume_set\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Disable the Point-in-Time Copy volume set associated with the specified
.IR volume_set .
.sp
If Point-in-Time Copy was running in
.B independent
mode as specified in
the
.B "-e ind"
options, above, the shadow volume data contains the
same data as it did before it was disabled (assuming no writes have
occurred). Users can access the master and shadow volumes, as they are now
standalone point-in-time copies.
.sp
During the time that the full copy is active, an
.B independent
volume
operates as though it is a
.B dependent
volume. To assure that the volume
is no longer in full copy mode, issue the following command to wait for the
full copy to complete:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# iiadm -w \fIvolume_set\fR
.fi
.in -2

Update the shadow volume from the master.
.sp
Updates a point-in-time copy of the master volume to the shadow volume.
\fIvolume_set\fR is the Point-in-Time Copy shadow set containing the master
and shadow volumes. This option provides a fast resynchronization of the
shadow volume, creating an incremental copy of the master. This update
copies all 32KB segments flagged as different between the master and shadow
volumes. It does not copy all master volume data, only changed data. While
the data is being copied, the shadow is dependent upon the master volume.
.sp
Before using this option, momentarily quiesce the workload to the volumes;
stop the host application from writing to the volumes. This ensures that the
point-in-time data is consistent. You can visually check the status of this
copy or update operation with
.BR "iiadm -i"
.IR volume_set ,
or
interactively (by means of a shell or script) with \fBiiadm -w\fR
.IR volume_set ,
before using the target volume for any other operations.
.sp
This command supports PID (Process IDentifier) locking, by using the option
.BR -p ,
.B iiadm -p
.BR "-u s" .
Enabling this option
prevents other processes from taking a new point-in-time snapshot, thus
invalidating prior point-in-time data.

\fIbitmap_vol\fR to be merged is the one obtained on the node that had
imported the independent shadow volume. There must be no write activity to
the shadow volume on the importing machine from the time the bitmap is
copied over until the shadow is once again imported.

This Point-in-Time Copy option is a modifier that limits configuration
operations to only those volumes belonging to a Sun Cluster Resource Group,
or Disk Group.
.sp
.RB "In a Sun Cluster where the volume manager is Sun Cluster-aware," " iiadm"
automatically obtains the correct Disk Group information, therefore this
option is typically not required unless the volumes are part of an
encompassing Resource Group.
.sp
In a Sun Cluster where the volumes are accessible on the local node only,
the special
.I cluster_tag
of
.B local
is used to indicate volumes
that are not part of a Sun Cluster Resource Group or Disk Group.
.sp
If "\fB-L\fR" is given as a the \fIcluster_tag\fR argument, then
\fBiiadm\fR lists all cluster tags associated with Point-in-Time Copy.

This option is invalid when used on a Solaris system on which the Sun
