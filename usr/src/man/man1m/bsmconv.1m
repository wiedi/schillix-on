.TH bsmconv 1M "20 Jan 2009" "SunOS 5.11" "System Administration Commands"
.SH NAME
bsmconv, bsmunconv \- enable or disable Solaris Auditing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/security/bsmconv\fR [\fIrootdir\fR]...
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/security/bsmunconv\fR [\fIrootdir\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBbsmconv\fR and \fBbsmunconv\fR scripts are used to enable or disable
the \fBBSM\fR features on a Solaris system. The optional argument
\fIrootdir\fR is a list of one or more root directories of diskless clients
that have already been configured. See \fBsmdiskless\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
To enable or disable \fBBSM\fR on a diskless client, a server, or a
stand-alone system, logon as super-user to the system being converted and
use the \fBbsmconv\fR or \fBbsmunconv\fR commands without any options.
.sp
.LP
To enable or disable \fBBSM\fR on a diskless client from that client's
server, logon to the server as super-user and use \fBbsmconv\fR, specifying
the root directory of each diskless client you wish to affect. For example,
the command:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
myhost# bsmconv /export/root/client1 /export/root/client2
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
enables \fBBSM\fR on the two machines named \fBclient1\fR and
\fBclient2\fR. While the command:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
myhost# bsmconv
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
enables \fBBSM\fR only on the machine called \fBmyhost\fR. It is no longer
necessary to enable \fBBSM \fRon both the server and its diskless clients.
.sp
.LP
After running \fBbsmconv\fR the system can be configured by editing the
files in \fB/etc/security\fR. Each diskless client has its own copy of
configuration files in its root directory. You might want to edit these
files before rebooting each client.
.sp
.LP
Following the completion of either script, the affected system(s) should be
rebooted to allow the auditing subsystem to come up properly initialized.
.SH FILES
