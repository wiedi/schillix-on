.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnisaddcred\fR command is used to create security credentials for
NIS+ principals. NIS+ credentials serve two purposes. The first is to
provide authentication information to various services; the second is to map
the authentication service name into a NIS+ principal name.
.sp
.LP
When the \fBnisaddcred\fR command is run, these credentials get created and
stored in a table named \fBcred.org_dir\fR in the default NIS+ domain. If
\fIdomain_name\fR is specified, the entries are stored in the
\fBcred.org_dir\fR of the specified domain. The specified domain must either
be the one to which you belong, or one in which you are authenticated and
authorized to create credentials, that is, a subdomain. Note that the
credentials of normal users must be stored in the same domain as their
passwords.
.sp
.LP
It is simpler to add credentials using \fBnisclient\fR(1M), because it
obtains the required information itself. \fBnispopulate\fR(1M) is used for
"bulk" updates and can also be used to add credentials for entries in the
\fBhosts\fR and the \fBpasswd\fR NIS+ tables.
.sp
.LP
NIS+ principal names are used in specifying clients that have access rights
to NIS+ objects. For more details, refer to the "Principal Names" subsection
of the \fBNIS+\fR(1) manual page. See \fBnischmod\fR(1), \fBnischown\fR(1),
\fBnis_objects\fR(3NSL), and \fBnis_groups\fR(3NSL). Various other services
can also implement access control based on these principal names.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcred.org_dir\fR table is organized as follows:
.sp

lw(1.06i) lw(.93i) lw(1.32i) lw(1.06i) lw(1.14i)

.TE

.sp
.LP
The \fBcname\fR column contains a canonical representation of the NIS+
principal name. By convention, this name is the login name of a user, or the
host name of a machine, followed by a dot ('.') followed by the fully
qualified "home" domain of that principal. For users, the home domain is
defined to be the domain where their \fBDES\fR credentials are kept. For
hosts, their home domain is defined to be the domain name returned by the
\fBdomainname\fR(1M) command executed on that host.
.sp
.LP
There are two basic types of \fIauth_type\fR entries in the
\fBcred.org_dir\fR table, those with authentication type \fBLOCAL,\fR and
those with authentication type \fBDES,\fR \fIauth_type\fR, specified on the
command line in upper or lower case, should be either \fIlocal\fR or
\fBdes\fR.
.sp
.LP
However, the \fBcred.org_dir\fR table may also be used to hold data for
other values of \fIauth_type\fR. Currently, this is limited to the
mechanisms listed on the \fBnisauthconf\fR(1M) man page, for which the
\fBnisaddcred\fR \fIauth_type\fR argument is the same as the name of the
mechanism. These mechanisms use a modified form of Secure RPC, and they are
similar to the \fBDES\fR authentication type.
.sp
.LP
If the \fIauth_type\fR is \fBdes\fR, and other authentication mechanisms
are configured with \fBnisauthconf\fR(1M), then credential entries are added
or updated for each mechanism configured. To only add or update 1992-bit
Diffie Hellman credentials, that is, those with the \fIauth_type\fR of
\fBDES,\fR use dh192-0 on the command line. If there are no authentication
mechanisms configured, using \fBdes\fR on the command line will only add or
update 192-bit Diffie Hellman credentials.
.sp
.LP
Entries of type \fBLOCAL\fR are used by the \fBNIS+\fR service to determine
the correspondence between fully qualified \fBNIS+\fR principal names and
users identified by \fBUIDs\fR in the domain containing the
\fBcred.org_dir\fR table. This correspondence is required when associating
requests made using the \fBAUTH_SYS\fR RPC authentication flavor (see
\fBrpc_clnt_auth\fR(3NSL)) to a NIS+ principal name. It is also required for
mapping a \fB UID\fR in one domain to its fully qualified NIS+ principal
name whose home domain may be elsewhere. The principal's credentials for any
authentication flavor may then be sought for within the \fBcred.org_dir\fR
table in the principal's home domain (extracted from the principal name).
The same \fBNIS+\fR principal may have \fBLOCAL\fR credential entries in
more than one domain. Only users, and not machines, have \fBLOCAL\fR
credentials. In their home domain, users of \fBNIS+\fR should have both
types of credentials.
.sp
.LP
The \fIauth_name\fR associated with the \fBLOCAL\fR type entry is a
\fBUID\fR that is valid for the principal in the domain containing the
\fBcred.org_dir\fR table. This may differ from that in the principal's home
domain. The public information stored in \fIpublic_data\fR for this type
contains a list of \fBGIDs\fR for groups in which the user is a member. The
\fBGIDs\fR also apply to the domain in which the table resides. There is no
private data associated with this type. Neither a \fBUID\fR nor a principal
name should appear more than once among the \fBLOCAL\fR entries in any one
\fBcred.org_dir\fR table.
.sp
.LP
The \fBDES\fR \fIauth_type\fR is used for Secure RPC authentication (see
\fBsecure_rpc\fR(3NSL)).
.sp
.LP
The authentication name associated with the \fBDES\fR \fIauth_type\fR is a
Secure RPC \fInetname\fR. A Secure RPC netname has the form
\fBunix.\fBid\fB@\fIdomain.com,\fR where \fIdomain\fR must be the
same as the domain of the principal. For principals that are users the
\fBid\fR must be the \fBUID\fR of the principal in the principal's home
domain. For principals that are hosts, the \fBid\fR is the host's name. In
Secure RPC, processes running under effective \fBUID\fR 0 (root) are
identified with the host principal. Unlike \fBLOCAL\fR, there cannot be more
than one \fBDES\fR credential entry for one NIS+ principal in the NIS+
namespace.
.sp
.LP
The public information in an entry of authentication type \fBDES\fR is the
public key for the principal. The private information in this entry is the
private key of the principal encrypted by the principal's network
password.
.sp
.LP
User clients of NIS+ should have credentials of both types in their home
domain. In addition, a principal must have a \fBLOCAL\fR entry in the
\fBcred.org_dir\fR table of each domain from which the principal wishes to
make authenticated requests. A client of NIS+ that makes a request from a
domain in which it does not have a \fBLOCAL\fR entry will be unable to
acquire \fBDES\fR credentials. A NIS+ service running at security level 2 or
higher will consider such users unauthenticated and assign them the name
\fInobody\fR for determining access rights.
.sp
.LP
This command can only be run by those NIS+ principals who are authorized to
add or delete the entries in the \fBcred\fR table.
.sp
.LP
If credentials are being added for the caller itself, \fBnisaddcred\fR
automatically performs a keylogin for the caller.
.sp
.LP
You can list the \fBcred\fR entries for a particular principal with
\fBnismatch\fR(1).
.sp
.LP
The \fBcred.org_dir\fR \fBNIS+\fR table replaces the maps
\fIpublickey.byname\fR and \fInetid.byname\fR used in \fBNIS (YP).\fR
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-p\fR \fIprincipal\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
The name \fIprincipal\fR specifies the name of the principal as defined by
the naming rules for that specific mechanism. For example, \fBLOCAL\fR
credential names are supplied with this option by including a string
specifying a \fBUID.\fR For \fBDES\fR credentials, the name should be a
Secure RPC netname of the form \fBunix.\fBid\fB@\fIdomain.com,\fR
as described earlier. If the \fB-p\fR option is not specified, the
\fIauth_name\fR field is constructed from the effective UID of the current
process and the name of the local domain.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-P\fR \fInis_principal\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
Use the \fBNIS+\fR principal name \fInis_principal\fR. This option should
be used when creating \fBLOCAL\fR or \fBDES\fR credentials for users whose
home domain is different than the local machine's default domain.
.sp
Whenever the \fB-P\fR option is not specified, \fBnisaddcred\fR constructs
a principal name for the entry as follows. When it is not creating an entry
of type \fBLOCAL,\fR \fBnisaddcred\fR calls \fBnis_local_principal\fR, which
looks for an existing \fBLOCAL\fR entry for the effective \fBUID\fR of the
current process in the \fBcred.org_dir\fR table and uses the associated
principal name for the new entry. When creating an entry of authentication
type \fBLOCAL\fR, \fBnisaddcred\fR constructs a default NIS+ principal name
by taking the login name of the effective \fBUID\fR for its own process, and
appending to it a dot ('.') followed by the local machine's default domain.
If the caller is a superuser, the machine name is used instead of the login
name.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-l\fR \fIlogin_password\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
Use the \fIlogin_password\fR specified as the password to encrypt the
secret key for the credential entry. This overrides the prompting for a
password from the shell. This option is intended for administration scripts
only. Prompting guarantees not only that no one can see your password on the
command line using \fBps\fR(1) but it also checks to make sure you have not
made any mistakes. \fIlogin_password\fR does not really have to be the
user's password but if it is, it simplifies logging in.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-r\fR [\fInis_principal\fR]\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
Remove all credentials associated with the principal \fInis_principal\fR
from the \fBcred.org_dir\fR table. This option can be used when removing a
client or user from the system. If \fInis_principal\fR is not specified the
default is to remove credentials for the current \fIuser\fR. If
\fIdomain_name\fR is not specified, the operation is executed in the default
NIS+ domain.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRAdding the \fBLOCAL\fR and \fBDES\fR Credentials
.sp
.LP
The following examples illustrate how to add the \fBLOCAL\fR and \fBDES\fR
credentials for some user, \fBuser1\fR, with a \fBUID\fR of \fB2990\fR, who
is an \fBNIS+\fR user principal in the \fBsome.domain.com.\fR NIS+ domain:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBnisaddcred -p 2990 -P user1.some.domain.com. local\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Note that credentials are always added in the \fBcred.org_dir\fR table in
the domain where \fBnisaddcred\fR is run, unless \fIdomain_name\fR is
specified as the last parameter on the command line. If credentials are
being added from the domain server for its clients, then \fIdomain_name\fR
should be specified. The caller should have adequate permissions to create
entries in the \fBcred.org_dir\fR table.

.sp
.LP
The system administrator can add a \fBDES\fR credential for the same user,
using the following example:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBnisaddcred -p unix.2990@some.domain.com -P user1.some.domain.com. des\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Please note that \fBDES\fR credentials can be added only after the
\fBLOCAL\fR credentials have been added. Also, if the system is configured
to use more than one authentication mechanism, credentials will be made for
each mechanism configured. See \fBnisauthconf\fR(1M).

.sp
.LP
Note that the secure RPC netname does not end with a dot ('.') while the
NIS+ principal name, specified with the \fB-P\fR option, does. This command
should be executed from a machine in the same domain as is the user.

.sp
.LP
The following example shows how to add a machine's \fBDES\fR credentials in
the same domain:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% nisaddcred -p unix.foo@some.domain.com -P foo.some.domain.com. des
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Please note that no \fBLOCAL\fR credentials are needed in this case.

.sp
.LP
The following example illustrates how to add a \fBNIS+\fR workstation's
principal \fBDES\fR credential:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBnisaddcred -p unix.host1@sub.some.domain.com \e
     -P newhost.sub.some.domain.com. des sub.some.domain.com.\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
This format is particularly useful if you are running this command from a
server which is in a higher domain than sub.some.domain.com. Without the
last option for domain name, \fBnisaddcred\fR would fail because it would
attempt to use the default domain of some.domain.com.

.sp
.LP
The following example illustrates adding \fBDES\fR credentials without
being prompted for the root login password:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBnisaddcred -p unix.2990@some.domain.com \e
     -P user1.some.domain.com. -l login_password des\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The following example shows how to add a credential for a user using a
specific authentication mechanism that was previously configured with
\fBnisauthconf\fR(1M). See \fBnisauthconf\fR(1M) for a list of the valid
values of \fIauth_type\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBnisaddcred -p unix.2990@some.domain.com \e
     -P user.1.some.domain.com dh640-0\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The password should be the same for all the credentials that belong to the
user. Otherwise, only the credentials encrypted with the user's password
will be used at login, and the user will have to run \fBchkey\fR(1) using
the \fB-p\fR option.

.sp
.LP
The following example shows how to add a \fBDES\fR credential when other
authentication mechanisms are configured on the system:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBnisaddcred -p unix.2990@some.domain.com \e
     -P user1.some.domain.com dh192-0\fR
