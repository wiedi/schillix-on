.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfbconf_xorg\fR utility configures Frame Buffer devices and some of the X11 window system defaults for Xorg by updating the \fBxorg.conf\fR configuration file.
.sp
.LP
The first \fBfbconf_xorg\fR command form shown in the \fBSYNOPSIS\fR section stores the specified option values in the \fBxorg.conf\fR configuration file. These settings are used to initialize the frame buffer device the next time the window system is run on that device. The persistence of these settings across window system sessions and system reboots is determined by the \fBxorg.conf\fR file.
.sp
.LP
The second and third command forms display information, and do not alter the \fBxorg.conf\fR file. The presence of the \fB-help\fR and/or \fB-res\fR \fB?\fR options will cause any other option (not shown in the third form) to be ignored.
.sp
.LP
You can configure only one frame buffer device at a time. To configure multiple devices, invoke the \fBfbconf_xorg\fR utility separately for each device.
.sp
.LP
Only frame buffer device options can be specified with \fBfbconf_xorg\fR. Use the normal window system options to specify default depth (see \fBsvccfg\fR(1M)), default visual class, and so forth. Specify these as device modifiers on the command line. See\fI Xserver(1)\fR, part of the OpenWindows, not the SunOS, man page collection.
.sp
.LP
You can specify which \fBxorg.conf\fR file to open. By default, \fBfbconf_xorg\fR opens the machine-specific file, \fB/etc/X11/xorg.conf\fR. Use the \fB-file\fR option to specify an alternate file. For example, the system-global file, \fB/usr/X11/xorg.conf\fR, can be opened instead.
.sp
.LP
These standard \fBxorg.conf\fR files can be written only by the superuser or someone with the Primary Administrator role. Consequently, the \fBfbconf_xorg\fR program is run with setuid root permission.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported for all frame buffer devices:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-defaults\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Sets configuration options for the specified device to their default values. This does not affect the \fB-res\fR video mode setting. See the device-specific portions of the \fBDEFAULTS\fR section below.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-dev\fR \fIdevice-file\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the frame buffer device by either its full pathname or simple filename (for example, \fB/dev/fbs/kfb0\fR or \fBkfb0\fR). Pathnames of installed devices can be displayed using the \fB-list\fR option to \fBfbconfig\fR(1M). If the \fB-dev\fR option is omitted, the default device, \fB/dev/fb\fR, is used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-file\fR \fBmachine\fR | \fBsystem\fR | \fIconfig-path\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies which \fBxorg.conf\fR file to open. If \fBmachine\fR is specified, the machine-specific \fB/etc/X11/xorg.conf\fR file is opened. If system is specified, the global \fB/usr/X11/xorg.conf\fR file is opened. The absolute pathname of  a configuration file can be used instead. If the specified file does not exist and is to be updated, it will be created. The file system that will contain the \fBxorg.conf\fR file must be writeable by someone with superuser-like privileges. This option has no effect unless other options are specified. The default is \fBmachine\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

The \fB-res\fR argument, \fBauto\fR, represents the video mode that is currently programmed into the device. The argument, \fBnone\fR, is a synonym for \fBauto\fR.

This option selects the default X visual. The \fBkfb\fR device provides an 8-bit PseudoColor visual whose pixels are disjoint from the rest of the visuals. This is called the overlay visual. Windows created in this visual will not damage windows created in other visuals. The converse, however, is not true: Windows created in other visuals will damage overlay windows.

If the value of this option is \fBtrue\fR, the overlay visual is the default visual. The default depth is 8-bit and the default class is PseudoColor. If \fBfalse\fR, the non-overlay visual that satisfies the other default visual selection options, such as the default depth and the default class, is chosen as the default visual.

.RS 4n
Loads the gamma correction table from the file specified by \fIgamma-correction-file\fR. This text file specifies the gamma correction values for the R, G, and B channels. Three consecutive values form an RGB triplet. For a \fBkfb\fR device, there must be exactly 256 RGB triplets. A value may be represented in hexadecimal, decimal, or octal format (for example, \fB0x3FF\fR, \fB1023\fR, or \fB01777\fR, respectively). Values are separated by one or more whitespace or new line characters. Comments begin with a hash sign character (\fB#\fR) and end at the end of the line.
.sp
You can load the gamma correction table with this option while the window system is running. The new gamma correction affects all the windows being displayed using the linear visuals. When gamma correction is done using a user-specified table, the gamma correction value (\fB-g\fR) is undefined. By default, the window system assumes a gamma correction value of \fB2.22\fR and loads the gamma table it creates corresponding to this value.

Certain options have implied default arguments. The default argument is used when the option is not present on the \fBfbconf_xorg\fR command line. For instance, a default argument for \fB-dev\fR is \fB/dev/fb\fR.
.sp
.LP
Options that set configuration state do not have implied defaults. The \fB-res\fR option is one example. If a configuration option is omitted from the \fBfbconf_xorg\fR command line, the corresponding \fBxorg.conf\fR configuration setting will remain unchanged. The exception is that if configuration options are mutually exclusive, setting one will automatically unset each of the others. An example is \fB-deflinear\fR, \fB-defoverlay\fR, and \fB-deftransparent\fR.

.LP
If a configuration setting is not present in the configura tion file when the window system is run, a default value will be used. For instance, the default state associated with \fB-res\fR is \fBauto\fR. A setting might not be present in the file, or the file itself might not exist, until \fBfbconf_xorg\fR has been invoked with the corresponding command line option.

The \fB-defaults\fR option sets the default values for most configuration settings.
