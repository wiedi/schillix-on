.SH NAME
ufsdump \- incremental file system dump
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/ufsdump\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIarguments\fR] \fIfiles_to_dump\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBufsdump\fR backs up all files specified by \fIfiles_to_dump\fR (usually
either a whole file system or files within a file sytem changed after a
certain date) to magnetic tape, diskette, or disk file.
.sp
.LP
The \fBufsdump\fR command can only be used on unmounted file systems, or
those mounted read-only. Attempting to dump a mounted, read-write file system
might result in a system disruption or the inability to restore files from
the dump. Consider using the \fBfssnap\fR(1M) command to create a file system
snapshot if you need a point-in-time image of a file system that is
mounted.
.sp
.LP
If a filesystem was mounted with the logging option, it is strongly
recommended that you run \fBufsdump\fR as the root user. Running the command
as a non-root user might result in the creation of an inconsistent dump.
.sp
.LP
\fIoptions\fR is a single string of one-letter \fBufsdump\fR options.
.sp
.LP
\fIarguments\fR may be multiple strings whose association with the options
is determined by order. That is, the first argument goes with the first
option that takes an argument; the second argument goes with the second
option that takes an argument, and so on.
.sp
.LP
\fIfiles_to_dump\fR is required and must be the last argument on the command
line. See
.B OPERANDS
for more information.
.sp
.LP
With most devices \fBufsdump\fR can automatically detect the end-of-media.
Consequently, the
.BR d ,
.BR s ,
and
.B t
options are not necessary for
multi-volume dumps, unless \fBufsdump\fR does not understand the way the
device detects the end-of-media, or the files are to be restored on a system
with an older version of the
.B restore
command.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB0\(mi9\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The "dump level." All files specified by \fIfiles_to_dump\fR that have been
modified since the last \fBufsdump\fR at a lower dump level are copied to the
\fIdump_file\fR destination (normally a magnetic tape device). For instance,
if a "level \fB2\fR" dump was done on Monday, followed by a "level \fB4\fR"
dump on Tuesday, a subsequent "level \fB3\fR" dump on Wednesday would contain
all files modified or added since the "level \fB2\fR" (Monday) backup. A
"level \fB0\fR" dump copies the entire file system to the \fIdump_file\fR.
.RE

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Archive file. Archive a dump table-of-contents in the specified
\fIarchive_file\fR to be used by \fBufsrestore\fR(1M) to determine whether a
file is in the dump file that is being restored.

Blocking factor. Specify the blocking factor for tape writes. The default is
20 blocks per write for tapes of density less than 6250BPI (bytes-per-inch).
The default blocking factor for tapes of density 6250BPI and greater is 64.
The default blocking factor for cartridge tapes (\fBc\fR option) is 126. The
highest blocking factor available with most tape drives is 126. Note: the
blocking factor is specified in terms of 512-byte blocks, for compatibility
with
.BR tar (1).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B c
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Cartridge. Set the defaults for cartridge instead of the standard half-inch
reel. This sets the density to 1000BPI and the blocking factor to 126. Since
\fBufsdump\fR can automatically detect the end-of-media, only the blocking
parameter normally has an effect. When cartridge tapes are used, and this
option is
.I not
specified, \fBufsdump\fR will slightly miscompute the
size of the tape. If the
.BR b ,
.BR d ,
\fBs\fR or \fBt\fR options are
specified with this option, their values will override the defaults set by
this option.

.RS 4n
Tape density. Not normally required, as \fBufsdump\fR can detect
end-of-media. This parameter can be used to keep a running tab on the amount
of tape used per reel. The default density is 6250BPI except when the \fBc\fR
option is used for cartridge tape, in which case it is assumed to be 1000BPI
per track. Typical values for tape devices are:

If \fIdump_file\fR is specified as \fB\(mi\fR, dump to
standard output.
.sp
If the name of the file is of the form \fImachine\fB:\fIdevice,\fR the
dump is done from the specified machine over the network using
.BR rmt (1M).
Since \fBufsdump\fR is normally run by root, the name of the local machine
must appear in the
.B /.rhosts
file of the remote machine. If the file is
specified as \fIuser\fB@\fImachine\fB:\fIdevice,\fR \fBufsdump\fR
will attempt to execute as the specified user on the remote machine. The
specified user must have a \fB\&.rhosts\fR file on the remote machine that
allows the user invoking the command from the local machine to access the
remote machine.

Autoload. When the end-of-tape is reached before the dump is complete, take
the drive offline and wait up to two minutes for the tape drive to be ready
again. This gives autoloading (stackloader) tape drives a chance to load a
new tape. If the drive is ready within two minutes, continue. If it is not,
prompt for another tape and wait.

Sets the tape label to

\fIstring\fR may be no more than sixteen characters long. If it is longer, it
is truncated and a warning printed; the dump will still be done. The tape
label is specific to the \fBufsdump\fR tape format, and bears no resemblance
to

Offline. Take the drive offline when the dump is complete or the
end-of-media is reached and rewind the tape, or eject the diskette. In the
case of some autoloading 8mm drives, the tape is removed from the drive
automatically. This prevents another process which rushes in to use the
drive, from inadvertently overwriting the media.

of the volume being dumped to. Not normally required,
as \fBufsdump\fR can detect end-of-media. When the specified size is reached,
\fBufsdump\fR waits for you to change the volume. \fBufsdump\fR interprets
the specified size as the length in feet for tapes and cartridges, and as the
number of 1024-byte blocks for diskettes. The values should be a little
smaller than the actual physical size of the media (for example, 425 for a
450-foot cartridge). Typical values for tape devices depend on the \fBc\fR

\fIfiles_to_dump\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the files to dump. Usually it identifies a whole file system by
its raw device name (for example,
.BR /dev/rdsk/c0t3d0s6 ).
Incremental
dumps (levels
.B 1
to
.BR 9 )
of files changed after a certain date only
apply to a whole file system. Alternatively, \fIfiles_to_dump\fR can identify
individual files or directories. All named directories that may be examined
by the user running
.BR ufsdump ,
as well as any explicitly-named files, are
dumped. This dump is equivalent to a level
.B 0
dump of the indicated
portions of the filesystem, except that
.B /etc/dumpdates
is not updated
even if the
.B -u
option has been specified. In all cases, the files must
be contained in the same file system, and the file system must be local to
the system where \fBufsdump\fR is being run.

.SH NOTES
.SS "Read Errors"
.sp
.LP
Fewer than 32 read errors on the file system are ignored.
.SS "Process Per Reel"
.sp
.LP
Because each reel requires a new process, parent processes for reels that
are already written hang around until the entire tape is written.
.SS "Operator Intervention"
.sp
.LP
\fBufsdump\fR requires operator intervention on these conditions: end of
volume, end of dump, volume write error, volume open error or disk read error
(if there are more than a threshold of 32). In addition to alerting all
operators implied by the
.B n
option, \fBufsdump\fR interacts with the
operator on \fBufsdump\fR's control terminal at times when \fBufsdump\fR can
no longer proceed, or if something is grossly wrong. All questions
\fBufsdump\fR poses \fImust\fR be answered by typing \fByes\fR or
.BR no ,
as appropriate.
.sp
.LP
Since backing up a disk can involve a lot of time and effort, \fBufsdump\fR
checkpoints at the start of each volume. If writing that volume fails for
some reason, \fBufsdump\fR will, with operator permission, restart itself
from the checkpoint after a defective volume has been replaced.
.SS "Suggested Dump Schedule"
.sp
.LP
It is vital to perform full, "level \fB0\fR", dumps at regular intervals.
When performing a full dump, bring the machine down to single-user mode using
.BR shutdown (1M).
While preparing for a full dump, it is a good idea to
clean the tape drive and heads. Incremental dumps should be performed with
the system running in single-user mode.
.sp
.LP
Incremental dumps allow for convenient backup and recovery of active files
on a more frequent basis, with a minimum of media and time. However, there
are some tradeoffs. First, the interval between backups should be kept to a
minimum (once a day at least). To guard against data loss as a result of a
media failure (a rare, but possible occurrence), capture active files on (at
least) two sets of dump volumes. Another consideration is the desire to keep
unnecessary duplication of files to a minimum to save both operator time and
media storage. A third consideration is the ease with which a particular
backed-up version of a file can be located and restored. The following
four-week schedule offers a reasonable tradeoff between these goals.

Although the Tuesday through Friday incrementals contain "extra copies" of
files from Monday, this scheme assures that any file modified during the week
can be recovered from the previous day's incremental dump.
.SS "Process Priority of ufsdump"
.sp
.LP
\fBufsdump\fR uses multiple processes to allow it to read from the disk and
write to the media concurrently. Due to the way it synchronizes between these
processes, any attempt to run dump with a
.B nice
(process priority) of
`\(mi5' or better will likely make \fBufsdump\fR run \fIslower\fR instead of
faster.
.SS "Overlapping Partitions"
.sp
.LP
Most disks contain one or more overlapping slices because slice 2 covers the
entire disk. The other slices are of various sizes and usually do not
overlap. For example, a common configuration places
.B root
on slice 0,
\fBswap\fR on slice 1, \fB/opt\fR on slice 5 and \fB/usr\fR on slice 6.
.sp
.LP
It should be emphasized that \fBufsdump\fR dumps one \fBufs\fR file system
at a time. Given the above scenario where slice 0 and slice 2 have the same
starting offset, executing \fBufsdump\fR on slice 2 with the intent of
dumping the entire disk would instead dump only the
.B root
file system on
slice 0. To dump the entire disk, the user must dump the file systems on each
slice separately.
.SH BUGS
.sp
.LP
The \fB/etc/vfstab\fR file does not allow the desired frequency of backup
for file systems to be specified (as \fB/etc/fstab\fR did). Consequently, the
\fBw\fR and \fBW\fR options assume file systems should be backed up daily,
which limits the usefulness of these options.
