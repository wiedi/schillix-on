.SH NAME
mountd \- server for NFS mount requests and NFS access checks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/nfs/mountd\fR [\fB-v\fR] [\fB-r\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBmountd\fR is an \fBRPC\fR server that answers requests for \fBNFS\fR
access information and file system mount requests. It reads the file
\fB/etc/dfs/sharetab\fR to determine which file systems are available for
mounting by which remote machines. See
.BR sharetab (4).
\fBnfsd\fR running
on the local server will contact
.B mountd
the first time an
.BR NFS
client tries to access the file system to determine whether the client
should get read-write, read-only, or no access. This access can be dependent
on the security mode used in the remoted procedure call from the client. See
.BR share_nfs (1M).
.sp
.LP
The command also provides information as to what file systems are mounted
by which clients. This information can be printed using the
.BR showmount (1M)
command.
.sp
.LP
The
.B mountd
daemon is automatically invoked by
.BR share (1M).
.sp
.LP
Only super user can run the
.B mountd
daemon.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The options shown below are supported for NVSv2/v3 clients. They are not
supported for Solaris NFSv4 clients.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -r
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Reject mount requests from clients. Clients that have file systems mounted
will not be affected.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -v
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
Run the command in verbose mode. Each time
.B mountd
determines what
access a client should get, it will log the result to the console, as well
as how it got that result.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Since
.B mountd
must be running for \fBnfsd\fR to function properly,
\fBmountd\fR is automatically started by the \fBsvc:/network/nfs/server\fR
service. See
.BR nfs (4).
.sp
.LP
Some routines that compare hostnames use case-sensitive string comparisons;
some do not. If an incoming request fails, verify that the case of the
hostname in the file to be parsed matches the case of the hostname called
for, and attempt the request again.
