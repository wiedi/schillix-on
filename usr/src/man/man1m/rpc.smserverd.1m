.SH NAME
rpc.smserverd \- removable media device server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/smedia/rpc.smserverd\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBrpc.smserverd\fR is a server that handles requests from client
applications, such as volume management software, for access to removable
media devices. In addition to volume management software, \fBrmformat\fR(1)
and the CDE Filemanager (when performing removable media operations) are
\fBrpc.smserverd\fR clients. The \fBrpc.smserverd\fR daemon is started by
.BR inetd (1M)
when a client makes a call to a Solaris-internal library to
access a SCSI, IDE, or USB device. The daemon is not started if a client
attempts to access a  floppy or PCMCIA device. Once started, the daemon
remains active until such time as it is idle for three minutes or more.
.sp
.LP
The
.B rpc.smserverd
daemon is provided for the exclusive use of the
client applications mentioned above. It has no external, customer-accessible
interfaces, including no configuration file.
