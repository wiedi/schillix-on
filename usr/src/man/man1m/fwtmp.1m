.SH NAME
fwtmp, wtmpfix \- manipulate connect accounting records
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/acct/fwtmp\fR [\fB-ic\fR]
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/acct/wtmpfix\fR [\fIfile\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBfwtmp\fR reads from the standard input and writes to the standard
output, converting binary records of the type found in \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR
to formatted ASCII records. The ASCII version is useful when it is necessary
to edit  bad records.
.sp
.LP
\fBwtmpfix\fR examines the standard input or named files in \fButmpx\fR
format, corrects the time/date stamps to make the entries consistent, and
writes to the standard output. A hyphen (\fB\(mi\fR) can be used in place of
\fIfile\fR to indicate the standard input. If time/date corrections are not
performed, \fBacctcon\fR(1M) will fault when it encounters certain
date-change records.
.sp
.LP
Each time the date is set, a pair of date change records are written to
.BR /var/adm/wtmpx .
The first record is the old date denoted by the string
"\fBold time\fR" placed in the \fBline\fR field and the flag
\fBOLD_TIME\fR placed in the \fBtype\fR field of the \fButmpx\fR
structure. The second record specifies the new date and is denoted by the
string
.B "new time"
placed in the
.B line
field and the flag
\fBNEW_TIME\fR placed in the \fBtype\fR field. \fBwtmpfix\fR
uses these records to synchronize all time stamps in the file.
.sp
.LP
In addition to correcting time/date stamps, \fBwtmpfix\fR will check the
validity of the
.B name
field to ensure that it consists solely of
alphanumeric characters or spaces. If it encounters a name that is
considered invalid, it will change the login name to
\fBINVALID\fR and write a diagnostic to the standard error. In
this way, \fBwtmpfix\fR reduces the chance that \fBacctcon\fR will fail when
processing connect accounting records.
