.TH groupmod 1M "27 Aug 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "System Administration Commands"
.SH NAME
groupmod \- modify a group definition on the system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/groupmod\fR [\fB-g\fR \fIgid\fR [\fB-o\fR]] [\fB-n\fR \fIname\fR] \fIgroup\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgroupmod\fR command modifies the definition of the specified group
by modifying the appropriate entry in the \fB/etc/group\fR file.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-g\fR \fIgid\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Specify the new group \fBID\fR for the group. This group \fBID\fR must be a
non-negative decimal integer less than \fBMAXUID\fR, as defined in
\fB<param.h>\fR\&. The group \fBID\fR defaults to the next available
(unique) number above 99. (Group IDs from 0-99 are reserved by SunOS for
future applications.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-n\fR \fIname\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Specify the new name for the group.  The \fIname\fR argument is a string of
no more than eight bytes consisting of characters from the set of lower case
alphabetic characters and numeric characters.  A warning message will be
written if these restrictions are not met.  A future Solaris release may
refuse to accept group fields that do not meet these requirements.  The
\fIname\fR argument must contain at least one character and must not include
a colon (\fB:\fR) or \fBNEWLINE\fR (\fB\en\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-o\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Allow the \fIgid\fR to be duplicated (non-unique).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBgroupmod\fR utility only modifies group definitions in the
\fB/etc/group\fR file. If a network name service such as \fBNIS\fR or
\fBNIS+\fR is being used to supplement the local \fB/etc/group\fR file with
additional entries, \fBgroupmod\fR cannot change information supplied by the
network name service. The \fBgroupmod\fR utility will, however, verify the
uniqueness of group name and group \fBID\fR against the external name
service.
.sp
.LP
\fBgroupmod\fR fails if a group entry (a single line in \fB/etc/group\fR)
exceeds 2047 characters.
