.SH NAME

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBfmd\fR is a daemon that runs in the background on each Solaris system. \fBfmd\fR receives telemetry information relating to problems detected by the system software, diagnoses these problems, and initiates proactive self-healing activities such as disabling faulty components. When appropriate, the fault manager also sends a message to the \fBsyslogd\fR(1M) service to notify an administrator that a problem has been detected. The message directs administrators to a knowledge article on Sun's web site, http://www.sun.com/msg/, which explains more about the problem impact and appropriate responses.
.sp
.LP
Each problem diagnosed by the fault manager is assigned a Universal Unique Identifier (\fBUUID\fR). The \fBUUID\fR uniquely identifes this particular problem across any set of systems. The \fBfmdump\fR(1M) utility can be used to view the list of problems diagnosed by the fault manager, along with their \fBUUID\fRs and knowledge article message identifiers. The \fBfmadm\fR(1M) utility can be used to view the resources on the system believed to be faulty. The \fBfmstat\fR(1M) utility can be used to report statistics kept by the fault manager. The fault manager is started automatically when Solaris boots, so it is not necessary to use the \fBfmd\fR command directly. Sun's web site explains more about what capabilities are currently available for the fault manager on Solaris.
