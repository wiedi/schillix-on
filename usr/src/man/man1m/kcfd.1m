.SH NAME
kcfd \- kernel-level cryptographic framework daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBkcfd\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBkcfd\fR daemon helps in managing CPU usage by cryptographic
operations performed in software by kernel threads. The system utilization
associated with these threads is charged to the \fBkcfd\fR process. It also
does module verification for kernel cryptographic modules.
.sp
.LP
Only a privileged user can run this daemon.
.sp
.LP
The \fBkcfd\fR daemon is automatically invoked in run level 1, after
\fB/usr\fR is mounted. A previously invoked \fBkcfd\fR daemon that is still
running must be stopped before invoking another \fBkcfd\fR command.
.sp
.LP
Manually starting and restarting \fBkcfd\fR is not recommended. If it is
necessary to do so, use the \fBcryptoadm\fR(1M) \fBstart\fR and \fBstop\fR
subcommands.
