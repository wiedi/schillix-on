.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBhalt\fR and \fBpoweroff\fR utilities write any pending information to the disks and then stop the processor. The \fBpoweroff\fR utility has the machine remove power, if possible.
.sp
.LP
The \fBhalt\fR and \fBpoweroff\fR utilities normally log the system shutdown to the system log daemon, \fBsyslogd\fR(1M), and place a shutdown record in the login accounting file \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR. These actions are inhibited if the \fB-n\fR or \fB-q\fR options are present.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBhalt\fR and \fBpoweroff\fR utilities do not cleanly shutdown \fBsmf\fR(5) services. Execute the scripts in \fB/etc/rcnum.d\fR or execute shutdown actions in \fBinittab\fR(4). To ensure a complete shutdown of system services, use \fBshutdown\fR(1M) or \fBinit\fR(1M) to reboot a Solaris system.
