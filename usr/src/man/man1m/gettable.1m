\fB/usr/sbin/gettable\fR \fIhost\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBgettable\fR is a simple program used to obtain the DoD Internet host table from a "hostname" server. The specified  \fIhost\fR is queried for the table. The table is placed in the file \fBhosts.txt\fR.

\fBgettable\fR operates by opening a \fBTCP\fR connection to the port indicated in the service specification for "hostname". A request is then made for all names and the resultant information is placed in the output file.
