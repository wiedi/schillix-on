.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrndc-confgen\fR utility generates configuration files for
\fBrndc\fR(1M). This utility can be used as a convenient alternative to
writing by hand the \fBrndc.conf\fR(4) file and the corresponding
\fBcontrols\fR and \fBkey\fR statements in \fBnamed.conf\fR. It can also be
run with the \fB-a\fR option to set up a \fBrndc.key\fR file and avoid
altogether the need for a \fBrndc.conf\fR file and a \fBcontrols\fR
statement.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-a\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Perform automatic \fBrndc\fR configuration. This option creates a file
\fBrndc.key\fR in \fB/etc\fR (or however \fIsysconfdir\fR was specified when
BIND was built) that is read by both \fBrndc\fR and \fBnamed\fR(1M) on
startup. The \fBrndc.key\fR file defines a default command channel and
authentication key allowing \fBrndc\fR to communicate with \fBnamed\fR with
no further configuration. Running \fBrndc-confgen\fR with \fB-a\fR specified
allows BIND 9 and \fBrndc\fR to be used as drop-in replacements for BIND 8
and \fBndc\fR, with no changes to the existing BIND 8 \fBnamed.conf\fR
file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-b\fR \fIkeysize\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Specify the size of the authentication key in bits. The \fIkeysize\fR
argument must be between 1 and 512 bits; the default is 128.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-c\fR \fIkeyfile\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Used with the \fB-a\fR option to specify an alternate location for
\fBrndc.key\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-h\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Print a short summary of the options and arguments to \fBrndc-confgen\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-k\fR \fIkeyname\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Specify the key name of the \fBrndc\fR authentication key. The
\fIkeyname\fR argument must be a valid domain name. The default is
\fBrndc-key\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-p\fR \fIport\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Specify the command channel port where \fBnamed\fR listens for connections
from \fBrndc\fR. The default is 953.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-r\fR \fIrandomfile\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Specify a source of random data for generating the authorization. By
default, \fB/dev/random\fR is used. The \fIrandomdev\fR argument specifies
the name of a character device or file containing random data to be used
instead of the default. The special value \fBkeyboard\fR indicates that
keyboard input should be used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-s\fR \fIaddress\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Specify the IP address where \fBnamed\fR listens for command channel
connections from \fBrndc\fR. The default is the loopback address
127.0.0.1.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-t\fR \fIchrootdir\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Used with the \fB-a\fR option to specify a directory where \fBnamed\fR will
run after the root directory is changed with \fBchroot\fR(1M). An additional
copy of the \fBrndc.key\fR will be written relative to this directory so
that it will be found by the \fBnamed\fR in the new directory.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-u\fR \fIuser\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Used with the \fB-a\fR option to set the owner of the \fBrndc.key\fR file
generated. If \fB-t\fR is also specified only the file in the chroot area
has its owner changed.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRCreate Automatic \fBrndc\fR Configuration
.sp
.LP
The following command creates an automatic \fBrndc\fR configuration, so
that \fBrndc\fR can be used immediately.

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRPrint a Sample \fBrndc.conf\fR File
.sp
.LP
The following command prints a sample \fBrndc.conf\fR file with
corresponding \fBcontrols\fR and \fBkey\fR statements. These statements can
subsequently be manually inserted in the file \fBnamed.conf\fR.
