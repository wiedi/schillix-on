.SH NAME
nisauthconf \- configure NIS+ security
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBnisauthconf\fR [\fB-v\fR] [\fImechanism\fR,]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBnisauthconf\fR controls which authentication flavors NIS+ should use
when communicating with other NIS+ clients and servers. If the command is
not executed, then NIS+ will default to the
.B AUTH_DES
authentication
flavor when running security level 2. See \fBrpc.nisd\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
\fBnisauthconf\fR takes a list of authentication \fImechanism\fR's in order
of preference. An authentication
.I mechanism
may use one or more
authentication flavors listed below. If
.B des
is the only specified
mechanism, then NIS+ only use
.B AUTH_DES
with other NIS+ clients and
servers. If
.B des
is the first mechanism, then other authentication
\fImechanism\fR's after \fBdes\fR will be ignored by NIS+, except for
.BR nisaddcred (1M).
After changing the mechanism configuration, the
.BR keyserv (1M)
daemon must be restarted. Note that doing so will remove
encryption keys stored by the running
.B keyserv
process. This means that
a
.B reboot
usually is the safest option when the mechanism configuration
has been changed.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1\fR Configuring a System with only \fBRPCSEC_GSS\fR
Authentication Flavor
.sp
.LP
To configure a system to use only the
.B RPCSEC_GSS
authentication
flavor with 640-bit Diffie-Hellman keys, execute the following as root:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fB/usr/lib/nis/nisauthconf dh640-0\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2\fR Configuring a System with both \fBRPCSEC_GSS\fR and
\fBAUTH_DES\fR Authentication Flavors
.sp
.LP
To configure a system to use both
.B RPCSEC_GSS
(with 640-bit
Diffie-Hellman keys) and
.B AUTH_DES
authentication flavors:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fB/usr/lib/nis/nisauthconf dh640-0 des\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3\fR Transitioning to Other Authentication Flavors
.sp
.LP
The following example can be used while adding credentials for a new
mechanism before NIS+ is authenticating with the new mechanism:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fB/usr/lib/nis/nisauthconf des dh640-0\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Note that except for
.BR nisaddcred "(1M), NIS+ will not use mechanisms"
that follow '\fBdes\fR.'

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
A NIS+ client of a server that is configured for either dh640-0 or dh1024-0
must run Solaris 7 or later, even if the server is also configured with
.BR des .
.sp
.LP
NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating
system. Tools to aid the migration from NIS+ to LDAP are available in the
current Solaris release. For more information, visit
