.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdevfsadm\fR(1M) maintains the \fB/dev\fR namespace. It replaces the
previous suite of \fBdevfs\fR administration tools including
\fBdrvconfig\fR(1M), \fBdisks\fR(1M), \fBtapes\fR(1M), \fBports\fR(1M),
\fBaudlinks\fR(1M), and \fBdevlinks\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
The default operation is to attempt to load every driver in the system and
attach to all possible device instances. Next, \fBdevfsadm\fR creates
logical links to device nodes in \fB/dev\fR and \fB/devices\fR and loads the
device policy.
.sp
.LP
\fBdevfsadmd\fR(1M) is the daemon version of \fBdevfsadm\fR(1M). The daemon
is started during system startup and is responsible for handling both
reconfiguration boot processing and updating \fB/dev\fR and \fB/devices\fR
in response to dynamic reconfiguration event notifications from the kernel.

.sp
.LP
For compatibility purposes, \fBdrvconfig\fR(1M), \fBdisks\fR(1M),
\fBtapes\fR(1M), \fBports\fR(1M), \fBaudlinks\fR(1M), and \fBdevlinks\fR(1M)
are implemented as links to \fBdevfsadm\fR.
.sp
.LP
In addition to managing \fB/dev\fR, \fBdevfsadm\fR also maintains the
\fBpath_to_inst\fR(4) database.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-C\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
Cleanup mode. Prompt \fBdevfsadm\fR to cleanup dangling \fB/dev\fR links
that are not normally removed. If the \fB-c\fR option is also used,
\fBdevfsadm\fR only cleans up for the listed devices' classes.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-c\fR \fIdevice_class\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
Restrict operations to devices of class \fIdevice_class\fR. Solaris defines
the following values for \fIdevice_class\fR: \fBdisk\fR, \fBtape\fR,
\fBport\fR, \fBaudio\fR, and \fBpseudo\fR. This option might be specified
more than once to specify multiple device classes.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-i\fR \fIdriver_name\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
Configure only the devices for the named driver, \fIdriver_name\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-n\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
Do not attempt to load drivers or add new nodes to the kernel device tree.

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-s\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
Suppress any changes to \fB/dev\fR. This is useful with the \fB-v\fR option
for debugging.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-t\fR \fItable_file\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
Read an alternate \fBdevlink.tab\fR file. \fBdevfsadm\fR normally reads
\fB/etc/devlink.tab\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-r\fR \fIroot_dir\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
Presume that the \fB/dev\fR directory trees are found under \fIroot_dir\fR,
not directly under \fBroot\fR (\fB/\fR). No other use or assumptions are
made about \fIroot_dir\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-v\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
Print changes to \fB/dev\fR in verbose mode.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
This document does not constitute an \fBAPI\fR. The \fB/devices\fR
directory might not exist or might have different contents or
interpretations in a future release. The existence of this notice does not
imply that any other documentation that lacks this notice constitutes an
\fBAPI\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBdevfsadm\fR no longer manages the \fB/devices\fR name space. See
\fBdevfs\fR(7FS).

The device configuration service is managed by the service management
facility, \fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier, and can be used to
start \fBdevfsadm\fR during reconfiguration boot by:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/system/device/local:default
.fi
.in -2

Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or
requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). The service's
status can be queried using the \fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
