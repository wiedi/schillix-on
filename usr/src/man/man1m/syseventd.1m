.SH NAME
syseventd \- kernel system event notification daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/sysevent/syseventd\fR [\fB-d\fR \fIdebug_level\fR] [\fB-r\fR \fIrootdir\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBsyseventd\fR is a user-level daemon that accepts delivery of system
event buffers from the kernel. Once an event buffer has been delivered to
.BR syseventd ,
it, in turn, attempts to propagate the event to all
interested end event subscribers.
.sp
.LP
Event subscribers take the form of a
.B syseventd
loadable module
(\fBSLM\fR). \fBsyseventd\fR passes the event buffer to each of its
subscribers and in return expects a notification as to the successful or
unsuccessful delivery attempt.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful delivery of the event buffer to all interested event
subscribers,
.B syseventd
frees the event buffer from the kernel event
queue.
