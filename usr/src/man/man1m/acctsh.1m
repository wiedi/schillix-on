.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "chargefee Command"
.sp
.LP
\fBchargefee\fR can be invoked to charge a \fInumber\fR of units to
.IR login-name .
A record is written to
.BR /var/adm/fee ,
to be merged
with other accounting records by
.BR runacct (1M).
.SS "ckpacct Command"
.sp
.LP
\fBckpacct\fR should be initiated using \fBcron\fR(1M) to periodically
check the size of
.BR /var/adm/pacct .
If the size exceeds
.IR blocks ,
\fB500\fR by default, \fBturnacct\fR will be invoked with argument
.BR switch .
To avoid a conflict with
.B "turnacct switch"
execution in
.BR runacct ,
do not run
.B ckpacct
and
.B runacct
simultaneously. If
the number of free disk blocks in the
.B /var
file system falls below
.BR 500 ,
\fBckpacct\fR will automatically turn off the collection of
process accounting records via the \fBoff\fR argument to
.BR turnacct .
When at least
.B 500
blocks are restored,  the accounting will be
activated again on the next invocation of
.BR ckpacct .
This feature is
sensitive to the frequency at which
.B ckpacct
is executed, usually by
the
.BR cron "(1M) command."
.SS "dodisk Command"
.sp
.LP
\fBdodisk\fR should be invoked by \fBcron\fR(1M) to perform the disk
accounting functions.
.SS "lastlogin Command"
.sp
.LP
\fBlastlogin\fR is invoked by \fBrunacct\fR(1M) to update
.BR /var/adm/acct/sum/loginlog ,
which shows the last date on which each
person logged in.
.SS "monacct Command"
.sp
.LP
\fBmonacct\fR should be invoked once each month or each accounting period.
\fInumber\fR indicates which month or period it is. If \fInumber\fR is not
given, it defaults to the current month (01\(mi12). This default is useful
if
.B monacct
is to executed using \fBcron\fR(1M) on the first day of
each month.
.B monacct
creates summary files in
\fB/var/adm/acct/fiscal\fR and restarts the summary files in
.BR /var/adm/acct/sum .
.SS "nulladm Command"
.sp
.LP
\fBnulladm\fR creates \fIfilename\fR with mode 664 and ensures that owner
and group are
.BR adm .
It is called by various accounting shell
procedures.
.SS "prctmp Command"
.sp
.LP
\fBprctmp\fR can be used to print the session record file (normally
\fB/var/adm/acct/nite/ctmp\fR created by \fBacctcon1\fR (see
.BR acctcon (1M)).
.SS "prdaily Command"
.sp
.LP
\fBprdaily\fR is invoked by \fBrunacct\fR(1M) to format a report of the
previous day's accounting data. The report resides in
\fB/var/adm/acct/sum/rprt/mmdd\fR where \fImmdd\fR is the month and day of
the report. The current daily accounting reports may be printed by typing
.BR prdaily .
Previous days' accounting reports can be printed by using the
\fImmdd\fR option and specifying the exact report date desired.
.SS "prtacct Command"
.sp
.LP
\fBprtacct\fR can be used to format and print any total accounting
(\fBtacct\fR)file.
.SS "shutacct Command"
.sp
.LP
\fBshutacct\fR is invoked during a system shutdown to turn process
accounting off and append a
.I reason
record to
.BR /var/adm/wtmpx .
.SS "startup Command"
.sp
.LP
\fBstartup\fR can be invoked when the system is brought to a multi-user
state to turn process accounting on.
.SS "turnacct Command"
.sp
.LP
\fBturnacct\fR is an interface to \fBaccton\fR (see \fBacct\fR(1M)) to turn
process accounting
.B on
or
.BR off .
The
.B switch
argument moves
the current
.B /var/adm/pacct
to the next free name in
\fB/var/adm/pacct.\fIincr\fR (where \fIincr\fR is a number starting with
\fB0\fR and incrementing by one  for each additional \fBpacct\fR file), then
.RB "turns accounting back on again. This procedure is called by" " ckpacct"
and thus can be taken care of by the
.BR cron "(1M) command and used to keep"
\fBpacct\fR to a reasonable size.   \fBshutacct\fR uses \fBturnacct\fR to
stop process accounting.
.B startup
uses
.B turnacct
to start
process accounting.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -c
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
This option prints a report of exceptional resource usage by command, and
may be used on current day's accounting data only.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -l
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
This option prints a report of exceptional usage by login id for the
specified date. Previous daily reports are cleaned up and therefore
inaccessible after each invocation of
.BR monacct .
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -o
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
This option uses
.B acctdusg
(see \fBacct\fR(1M)) to do a slower version
of disk accounting by login directory. \fIfilename\fRs specifies the one or
more filesystem names where disk accounting will be done.  If
\fIfilename\fRs are used, disk accounting will be done on these filesystems
only. If the
.B -o
option is used, \fIfilename\fRs should be mount points
of mounted filesystems. If the
.B -o
option is omitted, \fIfilename\fRs
should be the special file names of mountable filesystems.
