.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B unshare
command makes local file systems unavailable for mounting
by remote systems. The shared file system must correspond to a line with NFS
as the
.I FSType
in the file
.BR /etc/dfs/sharetab .
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -F
.ad
.RS 6n

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If the file system being unshared is a symbolic link to a valid pathname,
the canonical path (the path which the symbolic link follows) will be
unshared.
.sp
.LP
For example, if \fB/export/foo\fR is a symbolic link to \fB/export/bar\fR
(\fB/export/foo -> /export/bar\fR), the following \fBunshare\fR command will
result in
.B /export/bar
as the unshared pathname (and not
.BR /export/foo ):
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example#  unshare -F nfs /export/foo
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
For file systems that are accessed by NFS Version 4 clients, once the
unshare is complete, all NFS Version 4 state (open files and file locks) are
released and unrecoverable by the clients. If the intent is to share the
file system after some administrative action, the NFS daemon (\fBnfsd\fR)
should first be stopped and then the file system unshared. After the
administrative action is complete, the file system would then be shared and
the NFS daemon restarted. See \fBnfsd\fR(1M)
