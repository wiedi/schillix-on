.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlpusers\fR command  sets limits to the queue priority level that can
be assigned to  jobs submitted by users of the LP print service.
.sp
.LP
The first form of the command (with \fB-d\fR) sets the system-wide priority
default to \fIpriority-level\fR, where \fIpriority-level\fR is a value of 0
to 39, with 0 being the highest priority. If a user does not specify a
priority level with a print request (see \fBlp\fR(1)), the default priority
level is used. Initially, the default priority level is 20.
.sp
.LP
The second form of the command (with \fB-q\fR and \fB-u\fR) sets the
default highest \fIpriority-level\fR (\|0-39\|) that the users in
\fIlogin-ID-list\fR can request when submitting a print request. The
\fIlogin-ID-list\fR argument may include  any or all of the following
constructs:
.sp

.sp
.LP
Users that have been given a limit cannot submit a print request with a
higher priority level than the one assigned, nor can they change a request
that has already been submitted to have a higher priority. Any print
requests submitted with priority levels higher than allowed will be given
the highest priority allowed.
.sp
.LP
The third form of the command (with \fB-u\fR)  removes any explicit
priority level for the specified users.
.sp
.LP
The fourth form of the command (with \fB-q\fR) sets the default highest
priority level for all users not explicitly covered by the use of the second
form of this command.
.sp
.LP
The last form of the command (with \fB-l\fR)  lists the default priority
level and the priority limits assigned to users.
