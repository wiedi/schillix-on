.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBlpadmin\fR configures the LP print service by defining printers and
devices. It is used to add and change printers, to remove printers from
service, to set or change the system default destination, to define alerts
for printer faults, and to mount print wheels.
.SH OPTIONS

.LP
The options for each of the above categories are specified in the following
subsections.
.sp
.LP
Several options support the use of lists. A list might contain, for
example, user names, printers, printer forms, or content types. A list of
multiple items can have the form of either comma-separated names or have the
entire list enclosed by double quotes with a space between each name. For
example, both lists below are acceptable:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
one,two,three
"one two three"
.fi
.in -2

.SS "Adding or Changing a Printer"
.sp
.LP
The first form of the \fBlpadmin\fR command (\fBlpadmin\fR \fB-p\fR
\fIprinter\fR {\fIoptions\fR}) configures a new printer or changes the
configuration of an existing printer. It also starts the print scheduler.
.sp
.LP
When creating a new printer, one of three options (\fB-v\fR, \fB-U\fR, or
\fB-s\fR) must be supplied. In addition, only one of the following can be
supplied: \fB-e\fR, \fB-i\fR, or \fB-m\fR; if none of these three options is
supplied, the model standard is used. The \fB-h\fR and \fB-l\fR options are
mutually exclusive. Printer and class names must be no longer than 14
characters and must consist entirely of the characters \fBA\fR-\fBZ\fR,
\fBa\fR-\fBz\fR, \fB0\fR-\fB9\fR, dash (\fB-\fR) and underscore (\fB_\fR).
If \fB-s\fR is specified, the following options are invalid: \fB-A\fR,
\fB-e\fR, \fB-F\fR, \fB-h\fR, \fB-i\fR, \fB-l\fR, \fB-M\fR, \fB-m\fR,
\fB-o\fR, \fB-U\fR, \fB-v\fR, and \fB-W\fR.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fB-A\fR option is used to define an alert that informs the
administrator when a printer fault is detected, and periodically thereafter,

Write the message to the terminal on which the administrator is logged in.
If the administrator is logged in on several terminals, one is chosen
arbitrarily.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBquiet\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Do not send messages for the current condition. An administrator can use
this option to temporarily stop receiving further messages about a known
problem. Once the fault has been cleared and printing resumes, messages are
sent again when another fault occurs with the printer.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBshowfault\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Attempt to execute a fault handler on each system that has a print job in
the queue. The fault handler is \fB/etc/lp/alerts/printer\fR. It is invoked
with three parameters: \fIprinter_name\fR, \fBdate\fR, \fIfile_name\fR. The
\fIfile_name\fR is the name of a file containing the fault message.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBnone\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Do not send messages; any existing alert definition for the printer is
removed. No alert is sent when the printer faults until a different
alert-type (except \fBquiet\fR) is used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIshell-command\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Run the \fIshell-command\fR each time the alert needs to be sent. The shell
command should expect the message in standard input. If there are blank
spaces embedded in the command, enclose the command in quotes. Notice that
the \fBmail\fR and \fBwrite\fR values for this option are equivalent to the
values \fBmail\fR \fIuser-name\fR and \fBwrite\fR \fIuser-name\fR
respectively, where \fIuser-name\fR is the current name for the
administrator. This is the login name of the person submitting this command
unless he or she has used the \fBsu\fR command to change to another user ID.
If the \fBsu\fR command has been used to change the user ID, then the
\fIuser-name\fR for the new ID is used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBlist\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt
Display the type of the alert for the printer fault. No change is made to
the alert.
.RE

When a fault occurs, the printing subsystem displays a message indicating
that printing for a specified printer has stopped and the reason for the
stoppage. The message also indicates that printing will restart in a few
minutes and that you can enter an \fBenable\fR command if you want to
restart sooner than that.
.sp
Following a fault that occurs in the middle of a print job, the job is
reprinted from the beginning. An exception to this occurs when you enter a
command, such as the one shown below, that changes the page list to be
printed.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
% \fBlp\fB \fB-i\fB \fIrequest-id\fR \fB-P\fB .\|.\|.\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

For a given print request, the presence of multiple reasons for failure
indicate multiple attempts at printing.
.sp
The \fBLP\fR print service can detect printer faults only through an
adequate fast filter and only when the standard interface program or a
suitable customized interface program is used. Furthermore, the level of
recovery after a fault depends on the capabilities of the filter.
.sp
If, instead of a single printer, the keyword \fBall\fR is displayed in an
alert, the alert applies to all printers.
.sp
If the \fB-W\fR option is not used to arrange fault alerting for
\fIprinter\fR, the default procedure is to mail one message to the
administrator of \fIprinter\fR per fault. This is equivalent to specifying
\fB-W\fR \fBonce\fR or \fB-W\fR \fB0\fR. If \fIminutes\fR is a number
greater than zero, an alert is sent at intervals specified by
\fIminutes\fR.
.RE

\fB-f\fR \fBallow\fR:\fIform-list\fR

\fB-f\fR \fBdeny\fR:\fIform-list\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allow or deny the forms in \fIform-list\fR to be printed on \fIprinter\fR.
By default no forms are allowed on a new printer.
.sp
For each printer, the \fBLP\fR print service keeps two lists of forms: an
``allow-list'' of forms that can be used with the printer, and a
``deny-list'' of forms that cannot be used with the printer. With the
\fB-f\fB allow\fR option, the forms listed are added to the
allow-list and removed from the deny-list. With the \fB-f\fR \fBdeny\fR
option, the forms listed are added to the deny-list and removed from the
allow-list.
.sp
If the allow-list is not empty, only the forms in the list can be used on
the printer, regardless of the contents of the deny-list. If the allow-list
is empty, but the deny-list is not, the forms in the deny-list cannot be
used with the printer. All forms can be excluded from a printer by
specifying \fB-f\fR \fBdeny:all\fR. All forms can be used on a printer
(provided the printer can handle all the characteristics of each form) by
specifying \fB-f\fR \fBallow:all\fR.
.sp
The \fBLP\fR print service uses this information as a set of guidelines for
determining where a form can be mounted. Administrators, however, are not
restricted from mounting a form on any printer. If mounting a form on a
particular printer is in disagreement with the information in the allow-list
or deny-list, the administrator is warned but the mount is accepted.
Nonetheless, if a user attempts to issue a print or change request for a
form and printer combination that is in disagreement with the information,
the request is accepted only if the form is currently mounted on the
printer. If the form is later unmounted before the request can print, the
request is canceled and the user is notified by mail.
.sp
If the administrator tries to specify a form as acceptable for use on a
printer that does not have the capabilities needed by the form, the command
is rejected.
.sp
Notice the other use of \fB-f\fR, with the \fB-M\fR option, below.
.sp
The \fB-T\fR option must be invoked first with \fBlpadmin\fR to identify
the printer type before the \fB-f\fR option can be used.

\fIfault-recovery\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBcontinue\fR
.ad
.RS 13n

.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
Disable printing on \fIprinter\fR and wait for the administrator or a user
to enable printing again.
.sp
During the wait, the administrator or the user who submitted the stopped
print request can issue a change request that specifies where printing
should resume. (See the \fB-i\fR option of the \fBlp\fR command.) If no
change request is made before printing is enabled, printing resumes at the
top of the page where stopped, if the filter allows; otherwise, the request
is printed from the beginning.

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allow \fIprinter\fR to handle print requests with the content types listed
in a \fIcontent-type-list\fR.
.sp
The type \fBsimple\fR is recognized as the default content type for files
in the UNIX system. A \fBsimple\fR type of file is a data stream containing
only printable \fBASCII\fR characters and the following control
characters:
.sp

.sp
.TS
tab();
cw(1.83i) cw(1.83i) cw(1.83i)
lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i)

LINEFEED12Move to beginning of
 (newline) next line
FORMFEED14Move to beginning of
 next page
RETURN15Move to beginning of
 current line
.TE

To prevent the print service from considering \fBsimple\fR a valid type for
the printer, specify either an explicit value (such as the printer type) in
the \fIcontent-type-list\fR, or an empty list. If you do want \fBsimple\fR
included along with other types, you must include \fBsimple\fR in the
\fIcontent-type-list\fR.
.sp
In addition to content types defined by the print administrator, the type
\fBPostScript\fR is recognized and supported by the Solaris print subsystem.
This includes filters to support \fBPostScript\fR as the printer content
type.
.sp
The type \fBany\fR is recognized as a special content type for files. When
declared as the input type for a printer, it signals the print sub-system
not to do any filtering on the file before sending it to the printer.
.sp
Except for \fBsimple\fR and \fBany\fR, each \fIcontent-type\fR name is
determined by the administrator. If the printer type is specified by the
\fB-T\fR option, then the printer type is implicitly considered to be also a
valid content type.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Mount the form \fIform-name\fR on \fIprinter\fR. Print requests that need
the pre-printed form \fIform-name\fR is printed on \fIprinter\fR. If more
than one printer has the form mounted and the user has specified \fBany\fR
(with the \fB-d\fR option of the \fBlp\fR command) as the printer
destination, then the print request is printed on the one printer that also
meets the other needs of the request.
.sp
The page length and width, and character and line pitches needed by the
form are compared with those allowed for the printer, by checking the
capabilities in the \fBterminfo\fR database for the type of printer. If the
form requires attributes that are not available with the printer, the
administrator is warned but the mount is accepted. If the form lists a print
wheel as mandatory, but the print wheel mounted on the printer is different,
the administrator is also warned but the mount is accepted.
.sp
If the \fB-a\fR option is given, an alignment pattern is printed, preceded
by the same initialization of the physical printer that precedes a normal
print request, with one exception: no banner page is printed. Printing is
assumed to start at the top of the first page of the form. After the pattern
is printed, the administrator can adjust the mounted form in the printer and
press return for another alignment pattern (no initialization this time),
and can continue printing as many alignment patterns as desired. The
administrator can quit the printing of alignment patterns by typing
\fBq\fR.
.sp
If the \fB-o\fR \fBfilebreak\fR option is given, a formfeed is inserted
between each copy of the alignment pattern. By default, the alignment
pattern is assumed to correctly fill a form, so no formfeed is added.
.sp
If the \fB-t\fR \fItray-number\fR option is specified, printer tray
\fItray-number\fR is used.
.sp
A form is ``unmounted'' either by mounting a new form in its place or by
using the \fB-f\fR \fBnone\fR option. By default, a new printer has no form
mounted.

\fB-d\fR option of the \fBlp\fR command) as the printer destination, then
the print request is printed on the one printer that also meets the other

If the printer is a type that takes print wheels, then \fIlist\fR is a
comma or space separated list of print wheel names. These are the only print
wheels considered mountable on the printer. (You can always force a
different print wheel to be mounted.) Until the option is used to specify a
list, no print wheels are considered mountable on the printer, and print
requests that ask for a particular print wheel with this printer are
rejected.
.sp
If the printer is a type that has selectable character sets, then
\fIlist\fR is a list of character set name ``mappings'' or aliases. Each
``mapping'' is of the form \fIknown-name=alias\fR The \fIknown-name\fR is a
character set number preceded by \fBcs\fR (such as \fBcs3\fR for character
set three) or a character set name from the \fBterminfo\fR database entry
\fBcsnm\fR. See \fBterminfo\fR(4). If this option is not used to specify a
list, only the names already known from the \fBterminfo\fR database or
numbers with a prefix of \fBcs\fR is acceptable for the printer. If
\fIlist\fR is the word \fBnone\fR, any existing print wheel lists or

For each printer, the \fBLP\fR print service keeps two lists of users: an
``allow-list'' of people allowed to use the printer, and a ``deny-list'' of

The \fB-U\fR option allows your print service to access a remote printer.

centimeters (marked with a trailing \fBc\fR); numbers that show sizes in
inches (marked with a trailing \fBi\fR); and numbers that show sizes in
units appropriate to use (without a trailing letter), that is, lines,
characters, lines per inch, or characters per inch.

When using lpadmin to provide access to a remote printer, remote
configuration data is stored in \fB/etc/printers.conf\fR. This data includes
a \fBbsdaddr\fR and a \fBprinter-uri-supported\fR attribute. The data in
this file can be shared through the use of a network name service or
replicated across multiple systems. If the data is shared, it is important
to make sure that the \fBbsdaddr\fR and \fBprinter-uri-supported\fR contain
hostname information that is correctly resolved on all hosts sharing this
data. Also, the \fBprinter-uri-supported\fR is the preferred means of
accessing remote print service. The \fBbsdaddr\fR is supplied for backward
compatability with Solaris 2.6-10 systems.
