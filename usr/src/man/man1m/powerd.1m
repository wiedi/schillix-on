.SH NAME
powerd \- power manager daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/power/powerd\fR [\fB-n\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B powerd
daemon is started by \fBpmconfig\fR(1M) to monitor system
activity and perform an automatic shutdown using the suspend-resume feature.
When the system is suspended, complete current state is saved on the disk
before power is removed. On reboot, the system automatically starts a resume
operation and the system is restored to the same state it was in immediately
prior to suspend.
.sp
.LP
Immediately prior to system shutdown, the daemon notifies \fBsyslogd\fR(1M)
of the shutdown, which broadcasts a notification.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following option is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -n
.ad

notifying
.BR syslogd (1M).
