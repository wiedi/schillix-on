.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
If you do not specify any arguments to a \fBdscfgadm\fR command, the
utility interactively steps you through setting the configuration location
and starting the services. The configuration location is validated to ensure
it meets criteria such as size and file type before it is initialized for
use.

services. This setting is persistent across system boots.
