.SH NAME
audit_warn \- audit daemon warning script
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/security/audit_warn\fR [\fIoption\fR [\fIarguments\fR]]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBaudit_warn\fR utility processes warning or error messages from the
audit daemon. When a problem is encountered, the audit daemon,
\fBauditd\fR(1M) calls \fBaudit_warn\fR with the appropriate arguments. The
\fIoption\fR argument specifies the error type.
.sp
.LP
The system administrator can specify a list of mail recipients to be
notified when an audit_warn situation arises by defining a mail alias called
\fBaudit_warn\fR in \fBaliases\fR(4). The users that make up the
\fBaudit_warn\fR alias are typically the \fBaudit\fR and \fBroot\fR users.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBallhard\fR \fIcount\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Indicates that the hard limit for all filesystems has been exceeded
\fIcount\fR times. The default action for this option is to send mail to the
\fBaudit_warn\fR alias only if the \fIcount\fR is \fB1\fR, and to write a
message to the machine console every time. It is recommended that mail
\fInot\fR be sent every time as this could result in a the saturation of the
file system that contains the mail spool directory.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBallsoft\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Indicates that the soft limit for all filesystems has been exceeded. The
default action for this option is to send mail to the \fBaudit_warn\fR alias
and to write a message to the machine console.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBauditoff\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Indicates that someone other than the audit daemon changed the system audit
state to something other than \fBAUC_AUDITING\fB\&. \fR The audit
daemon will have exited in this case. The default action for this option is
to send mail to the \fBaudit_warn\fR alias and to write a message to the
machine console.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBebusy\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Indicates that the audit daemon is already running. The default action for
this option is to send mail to the \fBaudit_warn\fR alias and to write a
message to the machine console.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBgetacdir\fR \fIcount\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Indicates that there is a problem getting the directory list or plugin list
from \fBaudit_control\fR(4). The audit daemon will hang in a sleep loop
until the file is fixed. The default action for this option is to send mail
to the \fBaudit_warn\fR alias only if \fIcount\fR is \fB1\fR, and to write a
message to the machine console every time. It is recommended that mail
\fInot\fR be sent every time as this could result in a the saturation of the
file system that contains the mail spool directory.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBhard\fR \fIfilename\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Indicates that the hard limit for the file has been exceeded. The default
action for this option is to send mail to the \fBaudit_warn\fR alias and to
write a message to the machine console.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBnostart\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Indicates that auditing could not be started. The default action for this
option is to send mail to the \fBaudit_warn\fR alias and to write a message
to the machine console. Some administrators may prefer to modify
\fBaudit_warn\fR to reboot the system when this error occurs.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBplugin\fR \fIname\fR \fIerror\fR \fIcount\fR \fItext\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Indicates that an error occurred during execution of the \fBauditd\fR
plugin \fIname\fR. The default action for this option is to send mail to the
\fBaudit_warn\fR alias only if \fIcount\fR is 1, and to write a message to
the machine console every time. (Separate counts are kept for each error
type.) It is recommended that mail not be sent every time as this could
result in the saturation of the file system that contains the mail spool
directory. The \fItext\fR field provides the detailed error message passed
from the plugin. The \fIerror\fR field is one of the following strings:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBload_error\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Unable to load the plugin \fIname\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBsys_error\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The plugin \fIname\fR is not executing due to a system error such as a lack
of resources.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBconfig_error\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
No plugins loaded (including the binary file plugin,
\fBaudit_binfile\fR(5)) due to configuration errors in
\fBaudit_control\fR(4). The name string is \fB--\fR to indicate that no
plugin name applies.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBretry\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The plugin \fIname\fR reports it has encountered a temporary failure. For
example, the \fBaudit_binfree.so\fR plugin uses \fBretry\fR to indicate that
all directories are full.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBno_memory\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The plugin \fIname\fR reports a failure due to lack of memory.

\fBpostsigterm\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Indicates that an error occurred during the orderly shutdown of the audit
daemon. The default action for this option is to send mail to the

\fBtmpfile\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Indicates that the temporary audit file already exists indicating a fatal
error. The default action for this option is to send mail to the
\fBaudit_warn\fR alias and to write a message to the machine console.

If the audit policy \fBperzone\fR is set, the
\fB/etc/security/audit_warn\fR script for the local zone is used for
notifications from the local zone's instance of \fBauditd\fR. If the
\fBperzone\fR policy is not set, all \fBauditd\fR errors are generated by
the global zone's copy of \fB/etc/security/audit_warn\fR.
