FMRI stands for Fault Management Resource Identifier. It is used to
identify resources managed by the Fault Manager. See \fBfmd\fR(1M) and
\fBsmf\fR(5).

.LP
The
.B in.discardd
service provides the server-side of the discard
protocol. This protocol is used for debugging and bandwidth measurement and
is available on both TCP and UDP transports through port 9.
.sp
.LP
The
.B in.discardd
service is an
.BR inetd (1M)
.BR smf (5)
delegated
service. The
.B in.discardd
detects which transport is requested by
examining the socket it is passed by the
.B inetd
daemon.
.sp
.LP
The discard service simply throws away any data it receives from the
client.
