.B smbiod
is a helper program that initiates an SMB reconnection, when
needed.
.sp
.LP
When a user runs an
.B smbutil
or
.B mount_smbfs
command, an

process is started and continues to run until that user no
longer has any SMB client connections. Only one
.B smbiod
process runs
for each user that has SMB client connections.
.sp
.LP
Each
.B smbiod
process instantiates a door service on one of the
following files:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fB/tmp/.smbiod-\fIUID\fR file for normal users
