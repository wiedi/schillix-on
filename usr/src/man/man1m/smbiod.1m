.SH NAME
smbiod \- SMB client I/O daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/smbfs/smbiod\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBsmbiod\fR is a helper program that initiates an SMB reconnection, when
needed.
.sp
.LP
When a user runs an \fBsmbutil\fR or \fBmount_smbfs\fR command, an
\fBsmbiod\fR process is started and continues to run until that user no
longer has any SMB client connections. Only one \fBsmbiod\fR process runs
for each user that has SMB client connections.
.sp
.LP
Each \fBsmbiod\fR process instantiates a door service on one of the
following files:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fB/tmp/.smbiod-\fIUID\fR\fR file for normal users
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fB/var/run/smbiod-0\fR file for superuser
