.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBbootadm\fR command manages the boot archive and, with x86 boot
environments, the GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) menu. The
\fBupdate-archive\fR option provides a way for user to update the boot
archive as a preventative measure or as part of a recovery procedure. The
\fBset-menu\fR subcommand allows you to switch the \fBauto-boot\fR timeout
and default boot entry in the GRUB menu.
.sp
.LP
The \fBlist-menu\fR subcommand displays the location of the GRUB menu and
the current GRUB menu entries. While the typical location of the GRUB menu
is \fB/boot/grub/menu.lst\fR, depending on the install method used the
active GRUB menu might be located somewhere else. Use the \fBlist-menu\fR
subcommand to locate the active GRUB menu. For example, if a system was
installed using Live Upgrade, the GRUB menu might not be located in the
current boot environment. See the EXAMPLES section for typical output from
the \fBlist-menu\fR option.
.sp
.LP
Note that OpenBoot PROM (OBP)-based machines, such as SPARC systems, do not
use GRUB and have no boot menu manageable by \fBbootadm\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBbootadm\fR command determines dynamically the options supported by
the image to be managed, so that \fBbootadm\fR invoked on one platform can
be used to manage diskless clients of a different platform type.
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.sp
.LP
The \fBbootadm\fR command has the following subcommands:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBupdate-archive\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Updates current boot archive if required. Applies to both SPARC and x86
platforms.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBlist-archive\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Lists the files and directories to be included in the boot archive. Applies
to both SPARC and x86 platforms.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBset-menu\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Maintain the GRUB menu. The current GRUB menu is \fBboot/grub/menu.lst\fR,
relative to root. Do not depend on this location, because it is subject to
change. Applies to x86 platforms only.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBlist-menu\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Lists the location of the active GRUB menu, as well as the current GRUB
menu entries. This includes the autoboot-timeout, the default entry number,
and the title of each entry. Applies to x86 platforms only.
.RE

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The \fBbootadm\fR command has the following options:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-v\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
In an \fBupdate-archive\fR operation, stale files are displayed on
stderr.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-n\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
In an \fBupdate-archive\fR operation, archive content is checked but not
updated.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-p\fR \fIplatform\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The platform, or machine hardware class, of the client. The platform type
can only be specified together with \fB-R\fR, and is generally useful only
for managing a diskless client where the client is of a different platform
class than the server. Platform must be one of \fBi86pc\fR, \fBsun4u\fR, or
\fBsun4v\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-R\fR\ \fIaltroot\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Operation is applied to an alternate root path.
.LP
Note -
.sp
.RS 2
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with
the \fB-R\fR option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file system,
might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the
non-global zone's file system. See \fBzones\fR(5).

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUpdating the Current Boot Archive
.sp
.LP
The following command updates the current boot archive:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# bootadm update-archive
.fi
.in -2

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRUpdating the Boot Archive on an Alternate Root
.sp
.LP
The following command updates the boot archive on an alternate root:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# bootadm update-archive -R /a
.fi
.in -2

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRListing Installed OS Instances
.sp

The following command lists the installed operating system instances in a
GRUB menu:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# bootadm list-menu

default=0
timeout=10
(0) Solaris10
(1) Solaris10 Failsafe
(2) Linux
.fi
.in -2

.LP
\fBExample 4 \fRSwitching Default Boot Entry
.sp
.LP
The following command refers to the menu displayed in the previous example.
The user selects Linux (item 2).
