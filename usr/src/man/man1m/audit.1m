.SH NAME
audit \- control the behavior of the audit daemon

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBaudit\fR command is the system administrator's interface to maintaining the audit trail. The audit daemon can be notified to read the contents of the \fBaudit_control\fR(4) file and re-initialize the current audit directory to the first directory listed in the \fBaudit_control\fR file or to open a new audit file in the current audit directory specified in the \fBaudit_control\fR file, as last read by the audit daemon. Reading \fBaudit_control\fR also causes the \fBminfree\fR and \fBplugin\fR configuration lines to be re-read and reset within \fBauditd\fR. The audit daemon can also be signaled to close the audit trail and disable auditing.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Notify the audit daemon to close the current audit file and open a new audit file in the current audit directory.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Notify the audit daemon to read the audit control file. The audit daemon stores the information internally. If the audit daemon is not running but audit has been enabled by means of \fBbsmconv\fR(1M), the audit daemon is started.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Direct the audit daemon to close the current audit trail file, disable auditing, and die. Use \fB-s\fR to restart auditing.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR \fIpath\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Verify the syntax for the audit control file stored in \fIpath\fR. The \fBaudit\fR command displays an approval message or outputs specific error messages for each error found.
.RE

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp

The \fBaudit\fR command will exit with \fB0\fR upon success and a positive integer upon failure.

The \fBaudit\fR command does not modify a process's preselection mask. It functions are limited to the following:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
affects which audit directories are used for audit data storage;
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
specifies the minimum free space setting;
.RE

.ie t \(bu
.el o
resets the parameters supplied by means of the plugin directive.

For the \fB-s\fR option, \fBaudit\fR validates the \fBaudit_control\fR syntax and displays an error message if a syntax error is found. If a syntax error message is displayed, the audit daemon does not re-read \fBaudit_control\fR. Because \fBaudit_control\fR is processed at boot time, the \fB-v\fR option is provided to allow syntax checking of an edited copy of \fBaudit_control\fR. Using \fB-v\fR, \fBaudit\fR exits with 0 if the syntax is correct; otherwise, it returns a positive integer.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-v\fR option can be used in any zone, but the \fB-t\fR, \fB-s\fR, and \fB-n\fR options are valid only in local zones and, then, only if the \fBperzone\fR audit policy is set. See \fBauditd\fR(1M) and \fBauditconfig\fR(1M) for per-zone audit configuration.
