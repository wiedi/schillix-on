.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B metaset
command administers sets of disks in named disk sets. Named
disk sets include any disk set that is not in the local set. While disk sets
enable a high-availability configuration, Solaris Volume Manager itself does not
actually provide a high-availability environment.
.sp
.LP
A single-owner disk set configuration manages storage on a SAN or
fabric-attached storage, or provides namespace control and state database replica
management for a specified set of disks.
.sp
.LP
In a shared disk set configuration, multiple hosts are physically connected to
the same set of disks. When one host fails, another host has exclusive access to
the disks. Each host can control a shared disk set, but only one host can control
it at a time.
.sp
.LP
When you add a new disk to any disk set, Solaris Volume Manager checks the disk
format. If necessary, it repartitions the disk to ensure that the disk has an
appropriately configured reserved slice 7 (or slice 6 on an EFI labelled device)
with adequate space for a state database replica. The precise size of slice 7 (or
slice 6 on an EFI labelled device) depends on the disk geometry. For tradtional
disk sets, the slice is no less than 4 Mbytes, and probably closer to 6 Mbytes,
depending on where the cylinder boundaries lie. For multi-owner disk sets, the
slice is a minimum of 256 Mbytes. The minimal size for slice 7 might change in
the future. This change is based on a variety of factors, including the size of
the state database replica and information to be stored in the state database
replica.
.sp
.LP
For use in disk sets, disks must have a dedicated slice (six or seven) that
meets specific criteria:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The slice must start at sector 0
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The slice must include enough space for disk label
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The state database replicas cannot be mounted
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The slice does not overlap with any other slices, including slice 2
.RE
.sp
.LP
If the existing partition table does not meet these criteria, or if the -L flag
is specified, Solaris Volume Manager repartitions the disk. A small portion of
each drive is reserved in slice 7 (or slice 6 on an EFI labelled device) for use
by Solaris Volume Manager. The remainder of the space on each drive is placed
into slice 0. Any existing data on the disks is lost by repartitioning.
.sp
.LP
After you add a drive to a disk set, it can be repartitioned as necessary, with
the exception that slice 7 (or slice 6 on an EFI labelled device) is not altered
in any way.
.sp
.LP
After a disk set is created and metadevices are set up within the set, the
metadevice name is in the following form:
.sp
.LP
\fB/dev/md/\fIsetname\fR/{\fBdsk\fR,\fBrdsk\fR}/\fBd\fInumber\fR
.sp
.LP
where
.I setname
is the name of the disk set, and
.I number
is the number
of the metadevice (\fB0\fR-\fB127\fR).
.sp
.LP
If you have disk sets that you upgraded from Solstice DiskSuite software, the
default state database replica size on those sets is 1034 blocks, not the 8192
block size from Solaris Volume Manager. Also, slice 7 on the disks that were
added under Solstice DiskSuite are correspondingly smaller than slice 7 on disks
that were added under Solaris Volume Manager.
.sp
.LP
If disks you add to a disk set have acceptable slice 7s (that start at cylinder
0 and that have sufficient space for the state database replica), they are not
reformatted.
.sp
.LP
Hot spare pools within local disk sets use standard Solaris Volume Manager
naming conventions. Hot spare pools with shared disk sets use the following
convention:
.sp
.LP
\fIsetname\fR/\fIhot_spare_pool\fR
.sp
.LP
where
.I setname
is the name of the disk set, and
.I hot_spare_pool
is the
name of the hot spare pool associated with the disk set.
.SS "Multi-node Environment"
.sp
.LP
To create and work with a disk set in a multi\(emnode environment, \fBroot\fR
must be a member of Group 14 on all hosts, or the
.B /.rhosts
file must
contain an entry for all other host names. This is not required in a SunCluster
3.x enviroment.
.SS "Tagged data"
.sp
.LP
Tagged data occurs when there are different versions of a disk set's replicas.
This tagged data consists of the set owner's nodename, the hardware serial number
of the owner and the time it was written out to the available replicas. The
system administer can use this information to determine which replica contains
the correct data.
.sp
.LP
When a disk set is configured with an even number of storage enclosures and has
replicas balanced across them evenly, it is possible that up to half of the
replicas can be lost (for example, through a power failure of half of the storage
enclosures). After the enclosure that went down is rebooted, half of the replicas
are not recognized by SVM. When the set is retaken, the
.B metaset
command
returns an error of "stale databases", and all of the metadevices are in a
read-only state.
.sp
.LP
Some of the replicas that are not recognized need to be deleted. The action of
deleting the replicas also causes updates to the replicas that are not being
deleted. In a dual hosted disk set environment, the second node can access the
deleted replicas instead of the existing replicas when it takes the set. This
leads to the possibility of getting the wrong replica record on a disk set take.
An error message is displayed, and user intervention is required.
.sp
.LP
Use the
.B -q
to query the disk set and the
.BR -t ,
.BR -u ,
and
.BR -y ,
options to select the tag and take the disk set. See
.BR OPTIONS .
.SS "Mediator Configuration"
.sp
.LP
SVM provides support for a low-end HA solution consisting of two hosts that
share only two strings of drives. The hosts in this type of configuration,
referred to as
.B mediators
or mediator hosts, run a special daemon,
.BR rpc.metamedd (1M).
The mediator hosts take on additional responsibilities to
ensure that data is available in the case of host or drive failures.
.sp
.LP
A mediator configuration can survive the failure of a single host or a single
string of drives, without administrative intervention. If both a host and a
string of drives fail (multiple failures), the integrity of the data cannot be
guaranteed. At this point, administrative intervention is required to make the
data accessible. See \fBmediator\fR(7D) for further details.
.sp
.LP
Use the
.B -m
option to add or delete a mediator host. See
.BR OPTIONS .
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -a
.I drivename
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Add drives or hosts to the named set. For a drive to be accepted into a set, the
drive must not be in use within another metadevice or disk set, mounted on, or
swapped on. When the drive is accepted into the set, it is repartitioned and the
metadevice state database replica (for the set) can be placed on it. However, if
a slice 7 (or slice 6 on an EFI labelled device), starts at cylinder 0, and is
large enough to hold a state database replica, then the disk is not
repartitioned. Also, a drive is not accepted if it cannot be found on all hosts
specified as part of the set. This means that if a host within the specified set
is unreachable due to network problems, or is administratively down, the add
fails.
.sp
Specify a drive name in the form
\fBc\fInum\fBt\fInum\fBd\fInum\fR. Do not specify a slice number
(\fBs\fInum\fR). For drives in a Sun Cluster, you must specify a complete
pathname for each drive. Such a name has the form:

added and (for adding) up to two other aliases for the mediator host. The
nodename and aliases for each mediator host are separated only by commas. Up to
three mediator hosts can be specified for the named disk set. Specify only the
nodename of that host as the argument to
.B -m

Specify auto-take status for a disk set. If auto-take is enabled for a set, the
disk set is automatically taken at boot, and file systems on volumes within the
disk set can be mounted through
.B /etc/vfstab
entries. Only a single host can
be associated with an auto-take set, so attempts to add a second host to an
auto-take set or attempts to configure a disk set with multiple hosts as
auto-take fails with an error message. Disabling auto-take status for a specific
disk set causes the disk set to revert to normal behavior. That is, the disk set
is potentially shared (non-concurrently) among hosts, and unavailable for
mounting through
.BR /etc/vfstab .

Delete drives or hosts from the named disk set. For a drive to be deleted, it
must not be in use within the set. The last host cannot be deleted unless all of
the drives within the set are deleted. Deleting the last host in a disk set
destroys the disk set.

.RS 4n
Force one of three actions to occur: takes ownership of a disk set when used
with
.BR -t ;
deletes the last disk drive from the disk set; or deletes the last
host from the disk set. Deleting the last drive or host from a disk set requires
the
.B -d
option.
.sp
When used to forcibly take ownership of the disk set, this causes the disk set
to be grabbed whether or not another host owns the set. All of the disks within
the set are taken over (reserved) and fail fast is enabled, causing the other
host to panic if it had disk set ownership. The metadevice state database is read
in by the host performing the take, and the shared metadevices contained in the
set are accessible.
.sp
You can use this option to delete the last drive in the disk set, because this
drive would implicitly contain the last state database replica.
.sp
You can use
.B -f
option to delete hosts from a set. When specified with a
partial list of hosts, it can be used for one-host administration. One-host
administration could be useful when a host is known to be non-functional, thus
avoiding timeouts and failed commands. When specified with a complete list of
hosts, the set is completely deleted. It is generally specified with a complete
list of hosts to clean up after one-host administration has been performed.

Defining a Multi-Owner Disk Set
.sp
.LP
The following command defines a multi-owner disk set:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# metaset -s blue -M -a -h hahost1 hahost2
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The name of the disk set is
.BR blue .
The names of the first and second hosts
added to the set are
.B hahost1
and
.BR hahost2 ,
respectively. The hostname
is found in
.BR /etc/nodename .
Adding the first host creates the multi-owner
disk set. A disk set can be created with just one host, with additional hosts
added later. The last host cannot be deleted until all of the drives within the
set have been deleted.
