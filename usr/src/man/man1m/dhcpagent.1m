dhcpagent \- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client daemon

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdhcpagent\fR implements the client half of the Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol
.B (DHCP)
for machines running Solaris software.
.sp
.LP
The
.B dhcpagent
daemon obtains configuration parameters for the client
(local) machine's network interfaces from a
.B DHCP
server. These
parameters may include a lease on an
.B IP
address, which gives the
client machine use of the address for the period of the lease, which may be
infinite. If the client wishes to use the
.B IP
address for a period
longer than the lease, it must negotiate an extension using
.BR DHCP .
For
this reason,
.B dhcpagent
must run as a daemon, terminating only when the
client machine powers down.
.sp
.LP
For IPv4, the
.B dhcpagent
daemon is controlled through
\fBifconfig\fR(1M) in much the same way that the \fBinit\fR(1M) daemon is
controlled by
.BR telinit (1M).
.B dhcpagent
can be invoked as a user
process, albeit one requiring root privileges, but this is not necessary, as
\fBifconfig\fR(1M) will start it automatically.
.sp
.LP
For IPv6, the
.B dhcpagent
daemon is invoked automatically by
.BR in.ndpd (1M).
It can also be controlled through \fBifconfig\fR(1M), if
necessary.
.sp
.LP
When invoked,
.B dhcpagent
enters a passive state while it awaits
instructions from \fBifconfig\fR(1M) or
.BR in.ndpd (1M).
When it receives
a command to configure an interface, it brings up the interface (if
necessary) and starts DHCP. Once DHCP is complete,
.B dhcpagent
can be
queried for the values of the various network parameters. In addition, if
DHCP was used to obtain a lease on an address for an interface, it
configures the address for use. When a lease is obtained, it is
automatically renewed as necessary. If the lease cannot be renewed,
\fBdhcpagent\fR will unconfigure the address, but the interface will be left
up and
.B dhcpagent
will attempt to acquire a new address lease.
\fBdhcpagent\fR monitors system suspend/resume events and will validate any
non-permanent leases with the DHCP server upon resume. Similarly,
\fBdhcpagent\fR monitors link up/down events and will validate any
non-permanent leases with the DHCP server when the downed link is brought
back up. The lease validation mechanism will restart DHCP if the server
indicates that the existing lease is no longer valid. If the server cannot
be contacted, then the existing lease will continue. This behavior can be
modified with the
.B VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY
parameter in the
\fB/etc/default/dhcpagent\fR file. See the description of this parameter
below.
.sp
.LP
For IPv4, if the configured interface is found to be unplumbed, or to have
a different IP address, subnet mask, or broadcast address from those
obtained from DHCP, the interface is abandoned from DHCP control.
.sp
.LP
For IPv6,
.B dhcpagent
automatically plumbs and unplumbs logical
interfaces as necessary for the IPv6 addresses supplied by the server. The
IPv6 prefix length (netmask) is not set by the DHCPv6 protocol, but is
instead set by \fBin.ndpd\fR(1M) using prefix information obtained by Router
Advertisements. If any of the logical interfaces created by \fBdhcpagent\fR
is unplumbed, or configured with a different IP address, it will be
abandoned from DHCP control. If the link-local interface is unplumbed, then
all addresses configured by DHCP on that physical interface will be
removed.
.sp
.LP
In addition to
.BR DHCP ,
\fBdhcpagent\fR also supports \fBBOOTP\fR (IPv4
only). See
.IR "RFC 951, Bootstrap Protocol" .
Configuration parameters
obtained from a
.B BOOTP
server are treated identically to those received
from a
.B DHCP
server, except that the
.B IP
address received from a
\fBBOOTP\fR server always has an infinite lease.
.sp
.LP
\fBDHCP\fR also acts as a mechanism to configure other information needed
by the client, for example, the domain name and addresses of routers. Aside
from the IP address, and for IPv4 alone, the netmask, broadcast address, and
default router, the agent does not directly configure the workstation, but
instead acts as a database which may be interrogated by other programs, and
in particular by \fBdhcpinfo\fR(1).
.sp
.LP
On clients with a single interface, this is quite straightforward. Clients
with multiple interfaces may present difficulties, as it is possible that
some information arriving on different interfaces may need to be merged, or
may be inconsistent. Furthermore, the configuration of the interfaces is
asynchronous, so requests may arrive while some or all of the interfaces are
still unconfigured. To handle these cases, one interface may be designated
as primary, which makes it the authoritative source for the values of
\fBDHCP\fR parameters in the case where no specific interface is requested.
See
.BR dhcpinfo (1)
and \fBifconfig\fR(1M) for details.
.sp
.LP
For IPv4, the
.B dhcpagent
daemon can be configured to request a
particular host name. See the
.B REQUEST_HOSTNAME
description in the
\fBFILES\fR section. When first configuring a client to request a host name,
you must perform the following steps as root to ensure that the full DHCP
negotiation takes place:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# pkill dhcpagent
# rm /etc/dhcp/\fIinterface\fR.dhc
# reboot
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
All DHCP packets sent by
.B dhcpagent
include a vendor class identifier
(RFC 2132, option code 60; RFC 3315, option code 16). This identifier is the
same as the platform name returned by the
.B "uname -i"
command,
except:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Any commas in the platform name are changed to periods.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If the name does not start with a stock symbol and a comma, it is
automatically prefixed with
.BR SUNW .
.RE
.SS "Messages"
.sp
.LP
The
.B dhcpagent
daemon writes information and error messages in five
categories:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B critical
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Critical messages indicate severe conditions that prevent proper
operation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B errors
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Error messages are important, sometimes unrecoverable events due to
resource exhaustion and other unexpected failure of system calls; ignoring
errors may lead to degraded functionality.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B warnings
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Warnings indicate less severe problems, and in most cases, describe unusual
or incorrect datagrams received from servers, or requests for service that
cannot be provided.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBinformational\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Informational messages provide key pieces of information that can be useful
to debugging a
.B DHCP
configuration at a site. Informational messages
are generally controlled by the
.B -v
option. However, certain critical
pieces of information, such as the IP address obtained, are always provided.

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B debug
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Debugging messages, which may be generated at two different levels of
verbosity, are chiefly of benefit to persons having access to source code,
but may be useful as well in debugging difficult DHCP configuration
.RB "problems. Debugging messages are only generated when using the" " -d"
option.
.RE

.sp
.LP
When
.B dhcpagent
is run without the \fB-f\fR option, all messages are
sent to the system logger
.BR syslog "(3C) at the appropriate matching"
priority and with a facility identifier
.BR LOG_DAEMON .
When
\fBdhcpagent\fR is run with the \fB-f\fR option, all messages are directed
to standard error.
.SS "DHCP Events and User-Defined Actions"
.sp
.LP
If an executable (binary or script) is placed at \fB/etc/dhcp/eventhook\fR,
the
.B dhcpagent
deamon will automatically run that program when any of
the following events occur:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBBOUND\fR and \fBBOUND6\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
These events occur during interface configuration. The event program is
invoked when
.B dhcpagent
receives the DHCPv4 ACK or DHCPv6 Reply message
from the DHCP server for the lease request of an address, indicating
successful initial configuration of the interface. (See also the
\fBINFORM\fR and \fBINFORM6\fR events, which occur when configuration
parameters are obtained without address leases.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEXTEND\fR and \fBEXTEND6\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
These events occur during lease extension. The event program is invoked
just after
.B dhcpagent
receives the DHCPv4 ACK or DHCPv6 Reply from the
DHCP server for the DHCPv4 REQUEST (renew) message or the DHCPv6 Renew or
Rebind message.
.sp
Note that with DHCPv6, the server might choose to remove some addresses,
add new address leases, and ignore (allow to expire) still other addresses
in a given Reply message. The
.B EXTEND6
event occurs when a Reply is
received that leaves one or more address leases still valid, even if the
Reply message does not extend the lease for any address. The event program
is invoked just before any addresses are removed, but just after any new
addresses are added. Those to be removed will be marked with the
\fBIFF_DEPRECATED\fR flag.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEXPIRE\fR and \fBEXPIRE6\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
These events occur during lease expiration. For DHCPv4, the event program
is invoked just before the leased address is removed from an interface. For
DHCPv6, the event program is invoked just before the last remaining leased
addresses are removed from the interface.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBDROP\fR and \fBDROP6\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
These events occur during the period when an interface is dropped. The
event program is invoked just before the interface is removed from DHCP
control. If the interface has been abandoned due the user unplumbing the
interface, then this event will occur after the user's action has taken
place. The interface might not be present.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBINFORM\fR and \fBINFORM6\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
These events occur when an interface acquires new or updated configuration
information from a DHCP server by means of the DHCPv4
.B INFORM
or the
DHCPv6 Information-Request message. These messages are sent using an
\fBifconfig\fR(1M) \fBdhcp inform\fR command or when the DHCPv6 Router
Advertisement
.B O
(letter 0) bit is set and the
.B M
bit is not set.
Thus, these events occur when the DHCP client does not obtain an IP address
lease from the server, and instead obtains only configuration parameters.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B LOSS6
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This event occurs during lease expiration when one or more valid leases
still remain. The event program is invoked just before expired addresses are
.RB "removed. Those being removed will be marked with the" " IFF_DEPRECATED"
flag.
.sp
Note that this event is not associated with the receipt of the Reply
message, which occurs only when one or more valid leases remain, and occurs
only with DHCPv6. If all leases have expired, then the EXPIRE6 event occurs
instead.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBRELEASE\fR and \fBRELEASE6\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This event occurs during the period when a leased address is released. The
event program is invoked just before
.B dhcpagent
relinquishes the
address on an interface and sends the DHCPv4
.B RELEASE
or DHCPv6 Release
packet to the DHCP server.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The system does not provide a default event program. The file
\fB/etc/dhcp/eventhook\fR is expected to be owned by root and have a mode of
755.
.sp
.LP
The event program will be passed two arguments, the interface name and the
event name, respectively. For DHCPv6, the interface name is the name of the
physical interface.
.sp
.LP
The event program can use the
.BR dhcpinfo (1)
utility to fetch additional
information about the interface. While the event program is invoked on every
event defined above, it can ignore those events in which it is not
interested. The event program runs with the same privileges and environment
as
.B dhcpagent
itself, except that
.BR stdin ,
.BR stdout ,
and
\fBstderr\fR are redirected to
.BR /dev/null .
Note that this means that
the event program runs with root privileges.
.sp
.LP
If an invocation of the event program does not exit after 55 seconds, it is
sent a
.B SIGTERM
signal. If does not exit within the next three seconds,
it is terminated by a
.B SIGKILL
signal.
.sp
.LP
See EXAMPLES for an example event program.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -a
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Adopt a configured IPv4 interface. This option is for use with diskless
\fBDHCP\fR clients. In the case of diskless
.BR DHCP ,
\fBDHCP\fR has
already been performed on the network interface providing the operating
system image prior to running
.BR dhcpagent .
This option instructs the
agent to take over control of the interface. It is intended primarily for
use in boot scripts.
.sp
The effect of this option depends on whether the interface is being
adopted.
.sp
If the interface is being adopted, the following conditions apply:
.sp
\fBdhcpagent\fR uses the client id specified in
\fB/chosen\fR:\fI<client_id>\fR, as published by the PROM or as specified on
a \fBboot\fR(1M) command line. If this value is not present, the client id
is undefined. The DHCP server then determines what to use as a client id. It
is an error condition if the interface is an Infiniband interface and the
PROM value is not present.
.sp
If the interface is not being adopted:
.sp
\fBdhcpagent\fR uses the value stored in
.BR /etc/default/dhcpagent .
If
this value is not present, the client id is undefined. If the interface is
Infiniband and there is no value in
.BR /etc/default/dhcpagent ,
a client
id is generated as described by the draft document on DHCP over Infiniband,

interface parameter name.
.sp
To configure IPv6 parameters, place the string \fB\&.v6\fR between the
interface name (if any) and the parameter name. For example, to set the
global IPv6 parameter request list, use \fB\&.v6.PARAM_REQUEST_LIST\fR. To
set the

.na
.B VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Indicates that a
.B RELEASE
rather than a
.B DROP
should be performed
on managed interfaces when the agent terminates. Release causes the client
to discard the lease, and the server to make the address available again. Drop
causes the client to record the lease in \fB/etc/dhcp/\fIinterface\fR.dhc\fR
or \fB/etc/dhcp/\fIinterface\fR.dh6\fR
for later use. In addition, when the link status changes to
.B up
or when
the system is resumed after a suspend, the client will verify the lease with
the server. If the server is unreachable for verification, then the old
lease will be discarded (even if it has time remaining) and a new one
obtained.
.sp
Enabling this option is often desirable on mobile systems, such as laptops,
to allow the system to recover quickly from moves.

.nf
\fIdecimal\fR,\fIdata\fR.\|.\|.
0xHHHHH.\|.\|.
"\fIstring\fR...."
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The first form is an RFC 3315 DUID. This is legal for both IPv4 DHCP and
DHCPv6. For IPv4, an RFC 4361 Client ID is constructed from this value. In
this first form, the format of
.IR data .\|.\|.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The
.B dhcpagent
daemon can be used on IPv4 logical interfaces, just as
with physical interfaces. When used on a logical interface, the daemon
automatically constructs a Client ID value based on the DUID and IAID
values, according to RFC 4361. The \fB/etc/default/dhcpagent\fR
\fBCLIENT_ID\fR value, if any, overrides this automatic identifier.

As with physical IPv4 interfaces, the
.B /etc/hostname.hme0:1
and
\fB/etc/dhcp.hme0:1\fR files must also be created in order for \fBhme0:1\fR
to be automatically plumbed and configured at boot. In addition, unlike
physical IPv4 interfaces,
.B dhcpagent
does not add or remove default
routes associated with logical interfaces.

DHCP can be performed on IPMP IP interfaces to acquire and maintain IPMP
data addresses. Because an IPMP IP interface has no hardware address, the
daemon automatically constructs a Client ID using the same approach
described above for IPv4 logical interfaces. In addition, the lack of a
hardware address means the daemon must set the "broadcast" flag in all
\fBDISCOVER\fR and \fBREQUEST\fR messages on IPMP IP interfaces. Some DHCP
servers may refuse such requests.

DHCP can be performed on IP interfaces that are part of an IPMP group (to
acquire and maintain test addresses). The daemon will automatically set the
\fBNOFAILOVER\fR and \fBDEPRECATED\fR flags on each test address.
Additionally, the daemon will not add or remove default routes in this case.
Note that the actual DHCP packet exchange may be performed over any active
IP interface in the IPMP group. It is strongly recommended that test
addresses have infinite leases. Otherwise, an extended network outage
detectable only by probes may cause test address leases to expire, causing
.BR in.mpathd (1M)
to revert to link-based failure detection and trigger an
erroneous repair.

With DHCPv6, the link-local interface must be configured using
\fB/etc/hostname6.hme0\fR in order for DHCPv6 to run on \fBhme0\fR at boot
time. The logical interfaces for each address are plumbed by \fBdhcpagent\fR
automatically.
