.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcatman\fR utility creates the preformatted versions of the on-line
manual from the \fBnroff\fR(1) or \fBsgml\fR(5) input files. This feature
allows easy distribution of the preformatted manual pages among a group of
associated machines (for example, with \fBrdist\fR(1)), since it makes the
directories of preformatted manual pages self-contained and independent of
the unformatted entries.
.sp
.LP
\fBcatman\fR also creates the  \fBwindex\fR database file in the
directories specified by the  \fBMANPATH\fR or the  \fB-M\fR option. The
\fBwindex\fR database file is a three column list consisting of a keyword,
the reference page that the keyword points to, and a line of text that
describes the purpose of the utility or interface  documented on the
reference page. Each keyword is taken from the comma separated list of words
on the \fBNAME\fR line before the `\(mi' (dash). The reference page that the
keyword points to is the first word on the  \fBNAME\fR line. The text after
the \(mi on the \fBNAME\fR line is the descriptive text in the third column.
The \fBNAME\fR line must be immediately preceded by the page heading line
created by the \fB\&.TH\fR macro (see \fBNOTES\fR for required format).
.sp
.LP
Each manual page is examined and those whose preformatted versions are
missing or out of date are recreated. If any changes are made, \fBcatman\fR
recreates the \fBwindex\fR database.
.sp
.LP
If a manual page is a \fIshadow\fR page, that is, it sources another manual
page for its contents, a symbolic link is made in the \fBcat\fIx\fR or
\fBfmt\fIx\fR directory to the appropriate preformatted manual page.
.sp
.LP
Shadow files in an unformatted nroff source file are identified by the
first line being of the form \fB\&.so
man\fIx\fB/yyy.\fIx\fB\&.\fR
.sp
.LP
Shadow files in the \fBSGML\fR sources are identified by the string
\fBSHADOW_PAGE\fR. The file entity declared in the shadow file identifies
the file to be sourced.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-c\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
Create unformatted nroff source files in the appropriate \fBman\fR
subdirectories from the  \fBSGML\fR sources. This option will overwrite any
existing file in the \fBman\fR directory of the same name as the  \fBSGML\fR
file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-n\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
Do not create (or recreate) the \fBwindex\fR database. If the \fB-n\fR
option is specified, the \fBwindex\fR database is not created and the
\fBapropos\fR, \fBwhatis\fR, \fBman\fR \fB-f\fR, and \fBman\fR \fB-k\fR
commands will fail.
.RE

.sp

.rt

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-t\fR
.ad
.RS 20n

Create \fBtroff\fRed entries in the appropriate \fBfmt\fR subdirectories
instead of \fBnroff\fRing into the \fBcat\fR subdirectories.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-w\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
Only create the \fBwindex\fR database that is used by \fBwhatis\fR(1) and
the \fBman\fR(1) \fB-f\fR and \fB-k\fR options.  No manual reformatting is
done.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-M\fI directory\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
Update manual pages located in the specified \fIdirectory\fR,
(\fB/usr/share/man\fR by default). If the  \fB-M\fR option is specified, the
directory argument must not contain a `,' (comma), since a comma is used to
delineate section numbers. See \fBman\fR(1).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-T\fI macro-package\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
Use \fImacro-package\fR in place of the standard manual page macros, (
\fBman\fR(5) by default).
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIsections\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt
If there is one parameter not starting with a `\fB\(mi\fR\&', it is taken
to be a space separated list of manual sections to be processed by
\fBcatman\fR. If this operand is specified, only the manual sections in the
list will be processed.  For example,
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBcatman 1 2 3\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

only updates manual sections \fB1\fR, \fB2\fR, and \fB3\fR. If specific
sections are not listed, all sections in the  \fBman\fR directory specified
by the environment variable \fBMANPATH\fR are processed.
.RE

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBTROFF\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
The name of the formatter to use when the \fB-t\fR flag is given. If not
set, \fBtroff\fR(1) is used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBMANPATH\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
A colon-separated list of directories that are processed by \fBcatman\fR
and \fBman\fR(1). Each directory can be followed by a comma-separated list
of sections. If set, its value overrides \fB/usr/share/man\fR as the default
directory search path, and the \fBman.cf\fR file as the default section
search path. The \fB-M\fR and \fB-s\fR flags, in turn, override these
values.

.RE

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
If a user, who has previously run \fBcatman\fR to install the \fBcat*\fR
directories, upgrades the operating system, the entire \fBcat*\fR directory
structure should be removed prior to running \fBcatman\fR. See
\fBrm\fR(1).
.sp
.LP
Do not re-run \fBcatman\fR to re-build the \fBwhatis\fR database unless the
complete set of \fBman*\fR directories is present. \fBcatman\fR builds this
\fBwindex\fR file based on the  \fBman*\fR directories.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
To generate a valid windex index file, \fBcatman\fR has certain
requirements. Within the individual man page file, \fBcatman\fR requires two
macro lines to have a specific format. These are the \fB\&.TH \fRpage
heading line and the \fB\&.SH NAME \fRline.
.sp
.LP
The \fB\&.TH \fRmacro requires at least the first three arguments, that is,
the filename, section number, and the date.  The \fB\&.TH \fRline starts off
with the \fB\&.TH \fRmacro, followed by a space, the man page filename, a
single space, the section number, another single space, and the date. The
date should appear in double quotes and is specified as "day month year,"
with the month always abbreviated to the first three letters (Jan, Feb, Mar,
and so forth).
.sp
.LP
The \fB\&.SH NAME \fRmacro, also known as the \fBNAME \fRline, must
immediately follow the \fB\&.TH \fRline, with nothing in between those
lines. No font changes are permitted in the \fBNAME \fRline. The \fBNAME
\fRline is immediately followed by a line containing the man page filename;
then shadow page names, if applicable, separated by commas; a dash; and a
brief summary statement. These elements should all be on one line; no
carriage returns are permitted.
.sp
.LP
An example of proper coding of these lines is:

\&.SH NAME
nismatch, nisgrep \e- utilities for searching NIS+ tables
