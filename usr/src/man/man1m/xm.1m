.SH NAME
xm \- xVM management user interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBxm\fR \fIsubcommand\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIdomain\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The main interface for command and control of both xVM and guest domains is
\fBvirsh\fR(1M). Users should use \fBvirsh\fR wherever possible, as it
provides a generic and stable interface to controlling virtualized operating
systems. Some xVM operations are not yet implemented by \fBvirsh\fR. In
those cases, the legacy utility \fBxm\fR can be used for detailed control.
.sp
.LP
With minor variations, the basic structure of an \fBxm\fR command is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
xm \fIsubcommand\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIdomain\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\&...where \fIsubcommand\fR is one of the subcommands listed below,
\fIdomain\fR is the domain name (which is internally translated to a numeric
domain id), and \fIoptions\fR are subcommand-specific options. The
exceptions to this structure occur where a subcommand acts on all domains,
on the entire machine, or directly on the xVM hypervisor. These exceptions
are obvious in the descriptions of the subcommands.
.sp
.LP
All \fBxm\fR operations rely upon the xVM control daemon, \fBxend\fR(1M).
\fBxend\fR must be running before any \fBxm\fR commands can run. As
described in the man page, \fBxend\fR runs under the service management
facility (\fBsmf\fR(5)), which enables the daemon to start when a system is
booted.
.sp
.LP
Most \fBxm\fR subcommands require either root privileges or that you assume
the Primary Administrator role.
.sp
.LP
Most \fBxm\fR commands act asynchronously, so the fact that an \fBxm\fR
command returns immediately does not mean that the requested action is
complete. Many operations on domains, such as \fBcreate\fR and
\fBshutdown\fR, can take considerable time (30 seconds or more) to
complete.
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.sp
.LP
The \fBxm\fR program supports the subcommands listed below. The parameters
and options for a given subcommand are described in the description for that
subcommand.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBblock-attach\fR \fIdomain\fR \fIbe-dev\fR \fIfe-dev\fR \fImode\fR
[\fIbedomain\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Create a new virtual block device. This will notify the guest domain of the
new virtual block device..
.sp
The \fBblock-attach\fR subcommand has the following arguments and
options:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIdomain\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The guest domain name to which the device will be attached.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIbe-dev\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The device in the backend domain (domain 0) to be exported. This can be
specified as a physical partition (for example,
\fBphy:/dev/md/dsk/mydisk\fR, a ZFS volume or a normal file
('\fBfile:/export/disk-image\fR').
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIfe-dev\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The form, either a symbolic name or a numeric id, by which a device should
be identified to the guest domain. In Linux, an example of a symbolic name
is \fB/dev/hdc\fR. For Solaris guest domains, a single number should be
used. The specified number will correspond to a Solaris disk ID. For
example, disk ID 3 will have a slice 0 name of \fB/dev/dsk/c0d3s0\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fImode\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The access mode for the device from the guest domain. Supported modes are
\fBw\fR (read/write) and \fBr\fR (read-only).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIbedomain\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The backend domain hosting the device. This defaults to domain 0.
Currently, no other ID is supported.
.RE

\fImode\fR [\fIback_domain\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Change block device configuration. Used for changing CDs in an HVM
(hardware-based virtual machine) domain; in particular, changing the backend
device to refer to a different ISO file. See \fBblock-attach\fR for
parameter descriptions.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBblock-detach\fR \fIdomain\fR \fIdev-id\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Destroy a domain's virtual block device. \fIdevid\fR must be the device id
given to the device by domain 0. You must run \fBxm block-list\fR to
determine that number.

\fB\fBblock-list\fR [\fB-l\fR|\fB--long\fR] \fIdomain\fR\fR

.sp .6

has a single option:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR, \fB--long\fR\fR

.sp .6

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fBconsole\fR \fIdomain\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Attach to domain \fIdomain\fR's console. If you have set up your domains to
have a text-based login console, you receive a normal login screen.
.sp
The \fBconsole\fR supports only paravirtualized domains. The attached
console performs similarly to a serial console.
.sp
\fBcontrol-]\fR exits the virtual console.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBcreate\fR [\fIoption\fR] \fB-f\fR=\fIconfig-file\fR
[\fIname\fR=\fIvalue\fR]...\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fBcreate\fR subcommand creates a domain, according to the
specifications in the mandatory \fIconfig-file\fR argument. \fBcreate\fR
optionally accepts a set of name-value pairs that can override or add to the
variables defined in \fIconfig-file\fR.
.sp
\fIconfig-file\fR can be an absolute pathname.
.sp
The \fBcreate\fR subcommand returns immediately upon domain startup.
However, the starting of a domain is independent of the booting of the guest
operating system in that domain and independent of that OS's availability
for input.
.sp
The \fBcreate\fR and \fBnew\fR subcommands are legacy features. These
subcommands are used for existing domains that use the old configuration
file format. New domains should be created with \fBvirt-install\fR(1M).
.sp
The \fBcreate\fR subcommand has the following options:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fB\fB--console_autoconnect\fR\fR

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Use the given Python configuration script, \fIfile\fR.The configuration
script is loaded after arguments have been processed. Each command-line
option sets a configuration variable named after its long option name, and
these variables are placed in the environment of the script before it is
loaded. Variables for options that can be repeated have list values. Other
variables can be set using \fBvar=\fIvalue\fR\fR on the command line. After
the script is loaded, option values that were not set on the command line
are replaced by the values set in the script.
