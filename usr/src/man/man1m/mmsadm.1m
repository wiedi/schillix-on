.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The Media Management System (MMS) is a software interface that manages
removable storage media such as tape libraries, tape drives, media pools,
tape volumes, and disk resources that emulate tape drives and tape volumes.
It is an implementation of the IEEE 1244 specification for removable
media.
.sp
.LP
The MMS consists of an MM server and database that control various library
managers and drive managers. Administrators use \fBmmsadm\fR and its
subcommands to configure and maintain storage resources from a variety of
vendors. The MMS management commands, such as \fBmmsadm\fR, construct and
issue the most frequently-used Media Management Protocol (MMP) commands,
handling all events and acknowledgments. The MMP is defined in the IEEE 1244
specification.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmmsinit\fR(1M) command must be run to initialize MMS on a system
before you can use the \fBmmsadm\fR command.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmmsadm\fR command is RBAC-compliant. (See \fBrbac\fR(5).) Required
authorizations vary among individual subcommands and are listed in the
descriptions of those subcommands.
.SH SUB-COMMANDS
.sp
.LP
The \fBmmsadm\fR supports the subcommands listed below. Each subcommand
description includes a description of that subcommand's options and
operands. A \fBmmsadm\fR command takes the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBmmsadm\fR \fIsubcommand\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SS "\fBdiscover\fR Subcommand"
.sp
.LP
The \fBdiscover\fR subcommand displays the library, drives, or volumes on
an Automated Control System Library Server (ACSLS) server, or the tape
drives connected to the local system. Use this command to determine what
resources are available and whether they have been configured for use with
MMS.
.sp
.LP
\fBdiscover\fR requires the \fBsolaris.smf.read.mms\fR authorization. The
subcommand has the following syntax:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBmmsadm discover\fR [\fB-H\fR] [\fB-t\fR \fBlibrary\fR|\fBdrive\fR|\fBvol\fR]
     [\fB-S\fR \fIACSLS-host\fR[:\fIport\fR]] \fB-a\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The subcommand options are described as follows.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Displays all discovered resources, including those configured for MMS. By
default, only unconfigured resources are displayed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-H\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Displays the resources in a manner parseable by scripts. The display does
not include headers and it separates fields with a tab character.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-S\fR \fIACSLS-host\fR[:\fIport\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Displays resources managed by the specified server and port. The default
port number is 50004. If the \fB-S\fR option is not used, the command
displays tape drives connected to the local system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR \fBlibrary\fR|\fBdrive\fR|\fBvol\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR \fBlibrary\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Shows discovered libraries.
.RE

.sp

\fB\fB-t\fR \fBdrive\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR \fBvol\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Shows discovered volumes.
.RE

If this option is not used, library and drive resources are included in the
display. The number of volumes can be large so their discovery must be
requested explicitly.
.RE

.SS "\fBcreate\fR and \fBset\fR Subcommands"
.sp
.LP
The \fBcreate\fR subcommand configures the resource to be managed by MMS.
The \fBset\fR subcommand modifies the attributes of a resource managed by
MMS. These subcommands share a common set of options.
.sp
.LP
ACSLS-controlled libraries and disk archiving libraries are supported.
Libraries must be configured before any drive pool and drives managed in
that library can be configured, or any volumes managed by the library added
to media pools. \fBvoltype\fR must be configured before adding volumes to
media pools.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcreate\fR and \fBset\fR subcommands require the
\fBsolaris.smf.modify.mms\fR, \fBsolaris.smf.value.mms\fR,
\fBsolaris.mms.*\fR, and \fBsolaris.smf.read.mms\fR authorizations, with the
exception of changing tracing attributes. If changing the size of trace
files or trace level, only \fBsolaris.mms.device.log\fR and
\fBsolaris.smf.read.mms\fR authorizations are required.
.sp
.LP
These subcommands have the following syntax:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBcreate\fR \fB-t\fR \fBlibrary|drive|mpool|dpool|app|voltype\fR
     \fB-o\fR \fIoption\fR=\fIx\fR [\fB-o\fR \fIoption2\fR=\fIy\fR...] \fIname\fR

\fBset\fR \fB-t\fR \fBlibrary|drive|mpool|dpool|app|voltype\fR
