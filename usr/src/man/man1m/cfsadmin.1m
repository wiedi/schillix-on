.RE
.sp
.LP
You must always supply an option for \fBcfsadmin\fR. For each form of the
command except \fB-s\fR, you must specify a cache directory, that is, the
directory under which the cache is actually stored. A path name in the front
file system identifies the cache directory. For the \fB-s\fR form of the
command, you must specify a mount point.
.sp
.LP
You can specify a cache ID when you mount a file system with CacheFS, or
you can let the system generate one for you. The \fB-l\fR option includes
the cache ID in its listing of information. You must know the cache ID to
delete a cached file system.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-c\fR [ \fB-o\fR \fIcacheFS-parameters\fR ]
\fIcache_directory\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Create a cache under the directory specified by \fIcache_directory\fR. This
directory must not exist prior to cache creation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-d\fR { \fIcache_ID\fR | all } \fIcache_directory\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Remove the file system whose cache ID you specify and release its
resources, or remove all file systems in the cache by specifying \fBall\fR.
After deleting a file system from the cache, you must run the
\fBfsck_cachefs\fR(1M) command to correct the resource counts for the
cache.
.sp
As indicated by the syntax above, you must supply either a \fIcache_ID\fR
or \fBall\fR, in addition to \fIcache_directory\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-l\fR \fIcache_directory\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
List file systems stored in the specified cache, as well as statistics
about them. Each cached file system is listed by cache ID. The statistics
document resource utilization and cache resource parameters.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-s\fR { \fImntpt1\fR ... } | all\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Request a consistency check on the specified file system (or all
\fBcachefs\fR mounted file systems). The \fB-s\fR option only works if the
cache file system was mounted with \fBdemandconst\fR enabled (see
\fBmount_cachefs\fR(1M)). Each file in the specified cache file system is
checked for consistency with its corresponding file in the back file system.
Note that the consistency check is performed file by file as files are
accessed. If no files are accessed, no checks are performed. Use of this
option does not result in a sudden "storm" of consistency checks.
.sp
As indicated by the syntax above, you must supply one or more mount points,
or \fBall\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-u\fR [ \fB-o\fR \fIcacheFS-parameters\fR ]
\fIcache_directory\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Update resource parameters of the specified cache directory. Parameter
values can only be increased. To decrease the values, you must remove the
cache and recreate it. All file systems in the cache directory must be
unmounted when you use this option. Changes take effect the next time you
mount any file system in the specified cache directory. The \fB-u\fR option
with no \fB-o\fR option sets all parameters to their default values.
.RE

.SS "CacheFS Resource Parameters"
.sp
.LP
You can specify the following CacheFS resource parameters as arguments to
the \fB-o\fR option. Separate multiple parameters with commas.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBmaxblocks=\fIn\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Maximum amount of storage space that CacheFS can use, expressed as a
percentage of the total number of blocks in the front file system. If
CacheFS does not have exclusive use of the front file system, there is no
guarantee that all the space the \fBmaxblocks\fR parameter allows is
available. The default is \fB90\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBminblocks=\fIn\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Minimum amount of storage space, expressed as a percentage of the total
number of blocks in the front file system, that CacheFS is always allowed to
use without limitation by its internal control mechanisms. If CacheFS does
not have exclusive use of the front file system, there is no guarantee that
all the space the \fBminblocks\fR parameter attempts to reserve is
available. The default is \fB0\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBthreshblocks=\fIn\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
A percentage of the total blocks in the front file system beyond which
CacheFS cannot claim resources once its block usage has reached the level
specified by \fBminblocks\fR. The default is \fB85\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBmaxfiles=\fIn\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Maximum number of files that CacheFS can use, expressed as a percentage of
the total number of inodes in the front file system. If CacheFS does not
have exclusive use of the front file system, there is no guarantee that all
the inodes the \fBmaxfiles\fR parameter allows is available. The default is
\fB90\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBminfiles=\fIn\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Minimum number of files, expressed as a percentage of the total number of
inodes in the front file system, that CacheFS is always allowed to use
without limitation by its internal control mechanisms. If CacheFS does not
have exclusive use of the front file system, there is no guarantee that all
the inodes the \fBminfiles\fR parameter attempts to reserve is available.
The default is \fB0\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBthreshfiles=\fIn\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
A percentage of the total inodes in the front file system beyond which
CacheFS cannot claim inodes once its usage has reached the level specified
by \fBminfiles\fR. The default is \fB85\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBmaxfilesize=\fIn\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Largest file size, expressed in megabytes, that CacheFS is allowed to
cache. The default is \fB3\fR. You cannot decrease the block or inode
allotment for a cache. To decrease the size of a cache, you must remove it
and create it again with different parameters.
.sp
Currently \fBmaxfilesize\fR is ignored by \fBcachefs\fR, therefore, setting
it has no effect.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIcache_directory\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
The directory under which the cache is actually stored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fImntpt1\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
The directory where the CacheFS is mounted.

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of
\fBcfsadmin\fR when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte (
2^31 bytes).
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRCreating a Cache Directory
.sp
.LP
The following example creates a cache directory named \fB/cache\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# cfsadmin -c /cache
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRCreating a Cache
.sp
.LP
The following example creates a cache named \fB/cache1\fR that can claim a
maximum of 60 percent of the blocks in the front file system, can use 40
percent of the front file system blocks without interference by CacheFS
internal control mechanisms, and has a threshold value of 50 percent. The
threshold value indicates that after CacheFS reaches its guaranteed minimum,
it cannot claim more space if 50 percent of the blocks in the front file
system are already used.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# cfsadmin \fB-c\fR \fB-o\fR maxblocks=60,minblocks=40,threshblocks=50 /cache1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRChanging the \fBmaxfilesize\fR Parameter
.sp
.LP
The following example changes the \fBmaxfilesize\fR parameter for the cache
directory \fB/cache2\fR to 2 megabytes:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# cfsadmin \fB-u\fR \fB-o\fR maxfilesize=2 /cache2
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 4 \fRListing the Contents of a Cache Directory
.sp
.LP
The following example lists the contents of a cache directory named
\fB/cache3\fR and provides statistics about resource utilization:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# cfsadmin \fB-l\fR /cache3
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 5 \fRRemoving a Cached File System
.sp
.LP
The following example removes the cached file system with cache ID \fB23\fR
from the cache directory \fB/cache3\fR and frees its resources (the cache ID
is part of the information returned by \fBcfsadmin \fB-l\fR):

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# cfsadmin \fB-d\fR 23 /cache3
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 6 \fRRemoving All Cached File Systems
.sp
.LP
The following example removes all cached file systems from the cache
directory \fB/cache3\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# cfsadmin \fB-d\fR all /cache3
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 7 \fRChecking for Consistency in File Systems
.sp
.LP
The following example checks for consistency all file systems mounted with
\fBdemandconst\fR enabled. No errors are reported if no \fBdemandconst\fR
file systems were found.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fBcfsadmin\fR \fB-s\fR \fBall\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp
