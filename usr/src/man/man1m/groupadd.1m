.SH NAME
groupadd \- add (create) a new group definition on the system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/groupadd\fR [\fB-g\fR \fIgid\fR [\fB-o\fR]] \fIgroup\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgroupadd\fR command creates a new group definition on the system by
adding the appropriate entry to the \fB/etc/group\fR file.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-g\fR \fIgid\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Assigns the group id \fIgid\fR for the new group. This group id must be a
non-negative decimal integer below \fBMAXUID\fR as defined in
\fB/usr/include/sys/param.h\fR. The group \fBID\fR defaults to the next
available (unique) number above the highest number currently assigned. For
example, if groups  \fB100\fR, \fB105\fR, and  \fB200\fR are assigned as
groups, the next default group number will be  \fB201\fR. (Group \fBIDs\fR
from \fB0\fR\(mi\fB99\fR are reserved by SunOS for future applications.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-o\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Allows the \fIgid\fR to be duplicated (non-unique).
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIgroup\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
A string consisting of characters from the set of lower case alphabetic
characters and numeric characters. A warning message will be written if the
string exceeds \fBMAXGLEN,\fR which is usually set at eight characters. The
\fIgroup\fR field must contain at least one character; it accepts lower case
or numeric characters or a combination of both, and must not contain a colon
(\fB:\fR) or  \fBNEWLINE.\fR

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
\fBgroupadd\fR only adds a group definition to the local system. If a
network name service such as \fBNIS\fR or \fBNIS+\fR is being used to
supplement the local \fB/etc/group\fR file with additional entries,
\fBgroupadd\fR cannot change information supplied by the network name
service. However, \fBgroupadd\fR will verify the uniqueness of group name
and group \fBID\fR against the external name service.
.sp
.LP
If the number of characters in a \fBgroup\fR entry exceeds 2047, group
maintenance commands, such as \fBgroupdel\fR(1M) and \fBgroupmod\fR(1M),
fail.
