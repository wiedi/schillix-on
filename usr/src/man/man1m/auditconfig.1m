.SH NAME
auditconfig \- configure auditing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBauditconfig\fR \fIoption\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBauditconfig\fR provides a command line interface to get and set kernel
audit parameters.
.sp
.LP
This functionality is available only if the Solaris Auditing feature has been
enabled. See \fBbsmconv\fR(1M) for more information.
.sp
.LP
The setting of the \fBperzone\fR policy determines the scope of the audit
setting controlled by \fBauditconfig\fR. If \fBperzone\fR is set, then the
values reflect the local zone except as noted. Otherwise, the settings are for
the entire system. Any restriction based on the \fBperzone\fR setting is noted
for each option to which it applies.
.sp
.LP
A non-global zone administrator can set all audit policy options except
\fBperzone\fR and \fBahlt\fR. \fBperzone\fR and \fBahlt\fR apply only to the
global zone; setting these policies requires the privileges of a global zone
administrator. \fBperzone\fR and \fBahlt\fR are described under the
\fB-setpolicy\fR option, below.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp

.mk

\fB-aconf\fR

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Set the non-attributable audit mask from the \fBaudit_control\fR(4) file. For
example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# auditconfig -aconf
Configured non-attributable events.

\fB-audit\fR \fIevent\fR \fIsorf\fR \fIretval\fR \fIstring\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This command constructs an audit record for audit event \fIevent\fR using the
process's audit characteristics containing a text token \fIstring\fR. The
return token is constructed from the \fIsorf\fR (success/failure flag) and the
\fIretval\fR (return value). The event is type \fBchar*\fR, the \fIsorf\fR is
0/1 for success/failure, \fIretval\fR is an errno value, \fIstring\fR is type
\fB*char\fR. This command is useful for constructing an audit record with a
shell script. An example of this option:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# auditconfig -audit AUE_ftpd 0 0 "test string"
#

constructing and queuing audit records); \fBdisabled\fR, meaning that the

If plugin output is selected using \fBaudit_control\fR(4), the behavior of
the system with respect to the \fB-setpolicy\fR \fB+cnt\fR and the
\fB-setqhiwater\fR options is modified slightly. If \fB-setpolicy\fR
\fB+cnt\fR is set, data will continue to be sent to the selected plugin, even
though output to the binary audit log is stopped, pending the freeing of disk
space. If \fB-setpolicy\fR \fB-cnt\fR is used, the blocking behavior is as
described under OPTIONS, above. The value set for the queue high water mark is
used within \fBauditd\fR as the default value for its queue limits unless
overridden by means of the \fBqsize\fR attribute as described in
\fBaudit_control\fR(4).

The \fBauditconfig\fR options that modify or display process-based
information are not affected by the \fBperzone\fR policy. Those that modify
system audit data such as the terminal id and audit queue parameters are valid
only in the global zone, unless the \fBperzone\fR policy is set. The display
of a system audit reflects the local zone if \fBperzone\fR is set. Otherwise,
it reflects the settings of the global zone.

The \fB-setcond\fR option has been removed. Use \fBaudit\fR(1M) to enable or
disable auditing.

The \fB-getfsize\fR and \fB-setfsize\fR options have been removed. Use
\fBaudit_binfile\fR(5) \fBp_fsize\fR to set the audit file size.
