.SH NAME
devreserv \- reserve devices for exclusive use
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBdevreserv\fR [\fIkey\fR [\fIdevice-list\fR].\|.\|.]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdevreserv\fR reserves devices for exclusive use. When the device is no
longer required, use  \fBdevfree\fR to release it.
.sp
.LP
\fBdevreserv\fR reserves at most one device per
.IR device-list .
Each list
is searched in linear order until the first available device is found. If a
device cannot be reserved from each list, the entire reservation fails.
.sp
.LP
When 
.B devreserv
is invoked without arguments, it lists the devices that
are currently reserved and shows to which key it was reserved. When
\fBdevreserv\fR is invoked with only the  \fIkey\fR argument, it lists the
devices that are currently reserved to that key.
.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I device-list
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Defines a list of devices that
.B devreserv
will search to find an
available device. The list must be formatted as a single argument to the
shell.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I key
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Designates a unique key on which the device will be reserved. The key must be
a positive integer.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1\fR Reserving a Floppy Disk and a Cartridge Tape

.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2\fR Listing All Devices Currently Reserved
.sp
.LP
The following example lists all devices currently reserved:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ devreserv

  diskette1     10658
  ctape1        10658
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3\fR Listing All Devices Currently Reserved to a Particular Key
.sp

The following example lists all devices currently reserved to a particular
key:

.sp
.in +2

$ devreserv $key
  diskette1
  ctape1

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The commands
.B devreserv
and \fBdevfree\fR are used to manage the
availability of devices on a system. Their use is  on a participatory basis and
they do not place any  constraints on the actual access to the device. They
serve as a centralized bookkeeping point for those who wish to use them.
Devices which have been reserved  cannot be used by processes which utilize the
device reservation functions until the reservation has been canceled. However,
processes that do not use device reservation may use a device that has been
reserved since such a process would not have checked for its reservation
status.
