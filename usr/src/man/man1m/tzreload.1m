.SH NAME
tzreload \- notify timezone update
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/tzreload\fR [\fB-a\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtzreload\fR command notifies active (running) processes to reread
timezone information. The timezone information is cached in each process,
absent a \fBtzreload\fR command, is never reread until a process is
restarted. In response to a \fBtzreload\fR command, active processes reread
the current timezone information at the next call to \fBctime\fR(3C) and
\fBmktime\fR(3C). By default, the \fBtzreload\fR notification is sent to the
processes within the current zone.
.sp
.LP
In addition to notifying active processes, the \fBtzreload\fR command also
notifies cron(1M), to reinitialize the job scheduler with the new timezone
information.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Although \fBtzreload\fR reinitializes \fBcron\fR(1M), applications that are
affected by timezone changes still need to be restarted or reinitialized if
they do not reread the new timezone information before timezone changes take
place.
