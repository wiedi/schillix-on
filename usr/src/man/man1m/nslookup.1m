.SH NAME
nslookup \- query Internet name servers interactively
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBnslookup\fR [\fB-\fIoption\fR\fR] [\fIname\fR | \fB-\fR] [\fIserver\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnslookup\fR utility is a program to query Internet domain name
servers. It has two modes: interactive and non-interactive. Interactive mode
allows the user to query name servers for information about various hosts
and domains or to print a list of hosts in a domain. Non-interactive mode is
used to print just the name and requested information for a host or
domain.
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.LP
Interactive mode is entered in the following cases:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
No arguments are given (the default name server is used).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
The first argument is a hyphen (-) and the second argument is the host name
or Internet address of a name server.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Non-interactive mode is used when the name or Internet address of the host
to be looked up is given as the first argument. The optional second argument
specifies the host name or address of a name server.
.sp
.LP
Options can also be specified on the command line if they precede the
arguments and are prefixed with a hyphen. For example, to change the default
query type to host information, and the initial timeout to 10 seconds,
type:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
nslookup -query=hinfo  -timeout=10
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBhost\fR  [\fIserver\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Look up information for host using the current default server or using
server, if specified. If host is an Internet address and the query type is A
or PTR, the name of the host is returned. If host is a name and does not
have a trailing period, the search list is used to qualify the name.  To
look up a host not in the current domain, append a period to the name.

\fB\fBserver\fR \fIdomain\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fB\fBlserver\fR \fIdomain\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Change the default server to \fIdomain\fR; \fBlserver\fR uses the initial
server to look up information about \fIdomain\fR, while \fBserver\fR uses
the current default server. If an authoritative answer can't be found, the
names of servers that might have the answer are returned.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
\fBnslookup\fR and \fBdig\fR(1M) now report "Not Implemented" as
\fBNOTIMP\fR rather than \fBNOTIMPL\fR. This will have impact on scripts
that are looking for \fBNOTIMPL\fR.
.sp
.LP
BIND 9 nslookup is deprecated and not as full featured as its former BIND 8
version. For more features and functionality refer to \fBdig\fR(1M).
