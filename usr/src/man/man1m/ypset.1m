.TH ypset 1M "14 Sep 1992" "SunOS 5.11" "System Administration Commands"
.SH NAME
ypset \- point ypbind at a particular server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/ypset\fR [\fB-d\fR \fIypdomain\fR] [\fB-h\fR \fIhost\fR] \fIserver\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
In order to run
.BR ypset ,
\fBypbind\fR must be initiated with the
\fB\(miypset\fR or \fB\(miypsetme\fR options. See \fBypbind\fR(1M).
\fBypset\fR tells \fBypbind\fR to get NIS services for the specified
\fIypdomain\fR from the \fBypserv\fR process running on
.IR server .
If
\fIserver\fR is down, or is not running
.BR ypserv ,
this might not be
discovered until an NIS client process tries to obtain a binding for the
domain. At this point, the binding set by
.B ypset
is tested by
.BR ypbind .
If the binding is invalid,
.B ypbind
attempts to rebind for
the same domain.
.sp
.LP
\fBypset\fR is useful for binding a client node that is not on a broadcast
net, or is on a broadcast net that is not running an NIS server host. It is
also useful for debugging NIS client applications, for instance, where an
NIS map exists only at a single NIS server host.
.sp
.LP
Where several hosts on the local net are supplying NIS services,
\fBypbind\fR can rebind to another host, even while you attempt to find out
if the
.B ypset
operation succeeded.  For example, if you enter the
\fBypset\fR command below, you might get the subsequent response from
.BR ypwhich :
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% ypset host1
example% ypwhich
host2
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The sequence shown above is a function of the NIS subsystem's attempt to
.RB "load-balance among the available NIS servers, and occurs when" " host1"
does not respond to
.B ypbind
because it is not running
.B ypserv
(or
is overloaded), and
.BR host2 ,
running
.BR ypserv ,
obtains the
binding.
.sp
.LP
\fIserver\fR indicates which NIS server to bind to, and must be specified
as a name or an IP address. This works only if the node has a current valid
binding for the domain in question and
.B ypbind
has been set to allow
use of
.BR ypset .
In most cases,
.I server
should be specified as an IP
address.
.sp
.LP
\fBypset\fR tries to bind over a connectionless transport. The NIS library
call,
.BR yp_all() ,
uses connection-oriented transport and derives the NIS
server's address  based on the connectionless address supplied by
.BR ypset .
.sp
.LP
Refer to
.BR ypfiles (4)
for an overview of the NIS name service.
