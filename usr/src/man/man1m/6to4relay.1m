.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B 6to4relay
command is used to configure 6to4 relay router
communication. Relay router communication support is enabled by setting the
value of a variable that stores an IPv4 address within the
.B tun
module.
This variable is global to all tunnels and defines the policy for
communication with relay routers. By default, the address is set to
.B INADDR_ANY
.RB ( 0.0.0.0 ),
and the kernel interprets the value to
indicate that support for relay router communication is disabled. Otherwise,
support is enabled, and the specified address is used as the IPv4
destination address when packets destined for native IPv6 (non-6to4) hosts
are sent through the 6to4 tunnel interface. The
.B 6to4relay
command uses
a project private ioctl to set the variable.
.sp
.LP
\fB6to4relay\fR used without any options outputs the current, in-kernel,
configuration status. Use the
.B -a
option to send packets to a specific
relay router's
.B unicast
address instead of the default
.BR anycast
address. The address specified with the
.B -a
option does not specify the
policy for receiving traffic from relay routers. The source relay router on
a received packet is non-deterministic, since a different relay router may
be chosen for each sending native IPv6 end-point.
.sp
.LP
Configuration changes made by using the
.B 6to4relay
are not persistent
across reboot. The changes will persist in the kernel only until you take
the tunnel down
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The
.B 6to4relay
command supports the following options:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-a\fR \fIaddr\fR

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B -e
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
Enable support for relay router. Use
.B -a
\fIaddr\fR if it is
specified. Otherwise, use the default
.B anycast
address, 192.88.99.1.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I addr
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt
A specific relay router's unicast address.
.I addr
must be specified as
a dotted decimal representation of an IPv4 address. Otherwise, an error will
occur, and the command will fail.
