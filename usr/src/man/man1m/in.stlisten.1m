.SH NAME
in.stlisten \- Service Tag Listener
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/inet/in.stlisten\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBin.stlisten\fR daemon allows a mechanism for  discovering      the
location of  the Service Tag. By default, the \fBin.stlisten\fR daemon
listens for discovery probes (using  a minimal built-in protocol) on
\fBTCP\fR port 6481.
.sp
.LP
The daemon is under control of the service management facility,
\fBsmf\fR(5), under its \fBinetd\fR framework.  It only runs upon demand and
exits when no longer in use.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
In open networks where the participants may not always be trusted, it is
recommended that you deploy this daemon with the \fBpassphrase-encryption\fR
option. In \fBsmf\fR(5) environments, the following command can be used to
set the \fIpassphrase\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
< prepare a text file "passfile" containing the passphrase >
# chown svctag:daemon passfile
# chmod 600 passfile
svccfg -s svc:/network/stlisten \e
        setprop servicetag/passphrase=passfile
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where \fIpassfile\fR is the path of a file containing the intended
\fIpassphrase\fR.
.sp
.LP
This \fIpassphrase\fR can be subsequently cleared as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svccfg -s svc:/network/stlisten \e
        setprop servicetag/passphrase=""
.fi
.in -2
.sp
