.SH NAME
medstat \- check the status of mediator hosts for a given diskset
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/medstat\fR [\fB-q\fR] \fB-s\fR \fIsetname\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
If a specified diskset has been configured for mediators, \fBmedstat\fR
attempts to contact these hosts to see if they are accessible and returns
the results of the communication.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-q\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
This optional argument disables the printing of informative text. When used
with \fB-q\fR, \fBmedstat\fR still prints error messages and returns a
result code.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-s\fR \fIsetname\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Specifies the name of a diskset on which \fBmedstat\fR will work.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fR Checking diskset
.sp
.LP
This example checks the mediator hosts for the selected diskset.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# medstat -s relo-red
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The name of the diskset is \fBrelo-red\fR. The \fBmedstat\fR command prints
the status for each mediator host. Additionally, if the mediator quorum is
met, either through a ``golden'' mediator host or because half+1 of the
mediator hosts respond, the exit code is 0. If the quorum is not met, then
the exit code is 1. If no mediator hosts have been configured for the named
diskset, the exit code is 2. The status field will contain one of the
following values: Unreachable, Bad, Fatal, or Ok, where Unreachable
indicates an RPC/communication problem, Bad indicates an error in the
mediator data, Fatal indicates any other error condition, and Ok indicates
no error conditions.

.SH FILES
