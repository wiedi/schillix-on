.SH NAME
showrev \- show machine, software revision, and patch revision
information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/showrev\fR [\fB-a\fR] [\fB-p\fR | \fB-p\fR \fB-R\fR \fIroot_path\fR] [\fB-w\fR]
     [\fB-c\fR \fIcommand\fR] [\fB-s\fR \fIhostname\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBshowrev\fR displays revision information for the current hardware and
software. With no arguments, \fBshowrev\fR shows the system revision
information including hostname, hostid, release, kernel architecture,
application architecture, hardware provider, domain, and kernel version.
.sp
.LP
If a command is supplied with the \fB-c\fR option, \fBshowrev\fR shows the
\fBPATH\fR and \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR and finds out all the directories
within the \fBPATH\fR that contain it. For each file found, its file type,
revision, permissions, library information, and checksum are printed as
well.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-a\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Print all system revision information available. Window system and patch
information are added.
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-p\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-R\fR \fIroot_path\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Define the full path name of a directory to use as the \fIroot_path\fR. By
specifying the root path, \fBshowrev\fR retrieves the revision information
about the patch from package system information files located under a
directory tree starting at \fIroot_path\fR. The \fIroot_path\fR can be
specified when retrieving installed patch information in a client from a
server, for example, \fB/export/root/client1\fR.
.LP
Note -
.sp
.RS 2
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with
the \fB-R\fR option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file system,
might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the
non-global zone's file system. See \fBzones\fR(5).
