.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The commands
.B devreserv
and \fBdevfree\fR are used to manage the
availability of devices on a system. These commands do not place any
constraints on the access to the device. They serve only as a centralized
bookkeeping point for those who wish to use them. Processes that do not use
\fBdevreserv\fR may concurrently use a device with a process that has
reserved that device.
