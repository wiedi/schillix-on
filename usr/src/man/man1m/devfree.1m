.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBdevfree\fR \fIkey\fR [\fIdevice\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION

releases all devices that have been reserved for that  \fIkey\fR. When

the specified devices that have been reserved with that  \fIkey\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The commands \fBdevreserv\fR and \fBdevfree\fR are used to manage the
availability of devices on a system. These commands do not place any
constraints on the access to the device. They serve only as a centralized
bookkeeping point for those who wish to use them. Processes that do not use
\fBdevreserv\fR may concurrently use a device with a process that has
reserved that device.
