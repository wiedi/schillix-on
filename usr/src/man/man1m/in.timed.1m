The
.B in.timed
service provides the server-side of the time protocol.
The time server sends to requestors the time in seconds since midnight,
January 1, 1900. The time protocol is available on both TCP and UDP
transports through port 37.
.sp
.LP
The in.timed service is an \fBinetd\fR(1M)
.BR smf (5)
delegated service.
The
.B in.timed
detects which transport is requested by examining the
socket it is passed by the
.B inetd
daemon.
