.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fB Solstice Launcher\fR adds or removes local applications that are
private to the user (not local to the system) only. The properties of
globally registered applications that are used by local and remote users
sharing the software from a particular \fB/opt\fR directory cannot be
modified from the  \fBSolstice Launcher\fR. To register global applications
for use by local and remote users, use the \fBsoladdapp\fR(1M) command. To
remove globally registered applications, use the \fBsoldelapp\fR(1M)
command.
