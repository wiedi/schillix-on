.SH NAME
dfshares_nfs \- list available NFS resources from remote systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBdfshares\fR [\fB-F\fR nfs] [\fB-h\fR] [\fIserver\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdfshares\fR provides information about resources available to the host
through \fBNFS.\fR The \fB-F\fR flag may be omitted if  \fBNFS\fR is the
first file system type listed in the file \fB/etc/dfs/fstypes\fR.
.sp
.LP
The query may be restricted to the output of resources available from one
or more servers.
.sp
.LP
\fBdfshares\fR without arguments displays all resources shared on the local
system, regardless of file system type.
.sp
.LP
Specifying  \fIserver\fR displays information about the resources shared by
each server. \fIServer\fR can be any system on the network.  If no server is
specified, then     \fIserver\fR is assumed to be the local system.
.sp
.LP
The output of \fBdfshares\fR consists of an optional header line
(suppressed with the \fB-h\fR flag) followed by a list of lines containing
whitespace-separated fields.  For each resource, the fields are:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIresource server access transport\fR
.fi
.in -2

.ad
.RS 13n

A field may be null.  Each null field is indicated by a hyphen (-) unless
the remainder of the fields on the line are also null;  in which case, the
hyphen may be omitted.
