.SH NAME
mkdevalloc \- Make device_allocate entries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/mkdevalloc\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmkdevalloc\fR command writes to standard out a set of
\fBdevice_allocate\fR(4) entries describing the system's frame buffer, audio
and removable media devices.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmkdevalloc\fR command is used by the \fBinit.d\fR(4) scripts to
create or update the \fB/etc/security/device_allocate\fR file.
.sp
.LP
Entries are generated based on the device special files found in
\fB/dev\fR. For the different categories of devices, the \fBmkdevalloc\fR
command checks for the following files under \fB/dev\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
audio           /dev/audio, /dev/audioctl, /dev/sound/...
tape            /dev/rst*, /dev/nrst*, /dev/rmt/...
floppy          /dev/diskette, /dev/fd*, /dev/rdiskette, /dev/rfd*
removable disk  /dev/sr*, /dev/nsr*, /dev/dsk/c0t?d0s?, /dev/rdsk/c0t?d0s?
frame buffer    /dev/fb
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
All entries set the \fIdevice-minimum\fR and \fIdevice-maximum\fR fields to
the hex representations of \fBADMIN_LOW\fR and \fBADMIN_HIGH\fR,
respectively. The \fIdevice-authorization\fR field is set to
\fBsolaris.device.allocate\fR, except for the \fBframebuffer\fR entry, where
it is set to \fB*\fR. The \fIdevice-name\fR, \fIdevice-type\fR and
\fIdevice-clean\fR fields are set to the following values:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
                device-name      device-type   device-clean

audio           audio            audio         audio_clean_wrapper

floppy          floppy_0,1,...   fd            disk_clean
