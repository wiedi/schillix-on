.SH NAME
nislog \- display the contents of the NIS+ transaction log
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBnislog\fR displays the contents of the NIS+ server transaction log on
the standard output. This command can be used to track changes in the
namespace. The \fB/var/nis/trans.log\fR file contains the transaction log
maintained by the NIS+ server. When updates occur, they are logged to this
file and then propagated to replicas as log transactions. When the log is
checkpointed, updates that have been propagated to the replicas are
removed.
.sp
.LP
The \fBnislog\fR command can only be run on an NIS+ server by superuser. It
displays the log entries for that server only.
.sp
.LP
If \fIdirectory\fR is not specified, the entire log is searched. Otherwise,
only those logs entries that correspond to the specified directories are
displayed.
