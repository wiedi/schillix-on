.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBuserdel\fR utility only deletes an account definition that is in the
local \fB/etc/group\fR, \fB/etc/passwd\fR, \fB/etc/shadow\fR, and
\fB/etc/user_attr\fR file. file. If a network name service such as \fBNIS\fR
or \fBNIS+\fR is being used to supplement the local \fB/etc/passwd\fR file
with additional entries, \fBuserdel\fR cannot change information supplied by
the network name service.
