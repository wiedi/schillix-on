.SH NAME
lpsched \- start the LP print service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBlpsched\fR [\fB-f\fR \fInum_filters\fR] [\fB-n\fR \fInum_notifiers\fR] [\fB-p\fR \fIfd_limit\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The  \fBlpsched\fR command  starts or restarts the  \fBLP\fR print
service.
.sp
.LP
The  \fBlpshut\fR command stops the  \fBLP\fR print service.  Printers that
are restarted using \fBlpsched\fR reprint (in their entirety) print requests
that were stopped by  \fBlpshut\fR. See  \fBlpshut\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
It is recommended that you start  and stop the LP print service using
\fBsvcadm\fR(1M). See \fBNOTES\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-f\fI num_filters\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
Specifies the number of concurrent slow filters that may be run on a print
server. A default value of \fB1\fR is used if none is specified. Depending
on server configuration, a value of  \fB1\fR may cause printers to remain
idle while there are jobs queued to them.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-n\fI num_notifiers\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
Specifies the number of concurrent notification processes that can run on a
print server. A default value of  \fB1\fR is used when none is specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-p\fI fd_limit\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
Specifies the file descriptor resource limit for the  \fBlpsched\fR
process. A default value of  \fB4096\fR is used if none is specified. On
extremely large and active print servers, it may be necessary to increase
this value.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-r\fI reserved_fds\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt
Specifies the number of file descriptors that the scheduler reserves for
internal communications under heavy load. A default value of  \fB2\fR is
used when none is specified. It should not be necessary to modify this value
unless instructed to do so when troubleshooting problems under high load.
