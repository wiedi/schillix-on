.SH NAME
virt-clone \- clone virtual machine images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/virt-clone\fR [\fIoption\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBvirt-clone\fR utility is a command line tool for cloning existing
virtual machine images. \fBvirt-clone\fR copies disk images of an existing
virtual machine and defines a new guest with an identical virtual hardware
configuration. Elements that require uniqueness are updated to avoid a clash
between old and new guests.
.sp
.LP
With appropriate command-line arguments, \fBvirt-clone\fR can run
completely unattended, with the guest automatically starting itself as well.
This allows for easy automation of guest installs.
.sp
.LP
If you do not specify options to \fBvirt-clone\fR, the command runs
interactively, prompting for input as required.
.sp
.LP
To run \fBvirt-clone\fR, you must become superuser or assume the Primary
Administrator role.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB--connect\fR=\fIURI\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Connect to the hypervisor at \fIURI\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB-d\fR, \fB--debug\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Display debugging information when running the install process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-f\fR \fIdisk_image\fR, \fB--file\fR=\fIdisk_image\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Path to the file, disk partition, or logical volume to use as the backing
store for the guest's virtual disk. If the original guest has multiple
disks, this parameter must be repeated multiple times, once per disk in the
original virtual machine.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB--force-copy\fR=\fItarget\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Force to copy devices (for example, if \fBhdc\fR is a read-only CD-ROM
device, specify \fB--force-copy\fR=\fBhdc\fR)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Display the help message and exit.
.RE

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-m\fR \fImac_addr\fR, \fB--mac\fR=\fImac_addr\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Fixed MAC address for the guest. If the keyword \fBrandom\fR is specified,
a random address will be used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-n\fR \fIname\fR, \fB--name\fR=\fIname\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Name of the new guest virtual machine instance. This must be unique among
all guests known to the hypervisor on this machine, including those not
currently active. To redefine an existing guest, use the \fBvirsh\fR(1M)
tool to shut it down and delete it prior to running \fBvirt-clone\fR. This
parameter will be prompted for if omitted on the command line.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB--nonsparse\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Do not use a sparse file for the clone's disk image.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-o\fR \fIoriginal_guest\fR,
\fB--original\fR=\fIoriginal_guest\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Name or UUID for the original guest to be cloned. This guest must be shut
down since it is not possible to safely clone active guests.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB--original-xml\fR=\fIfilename\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fBlibvirt\fR guest XML file to use as the original guest. The guest
does not need to be defined on the \fBlibvirt\fR connection.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB--preserve-data\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Preserve a new file to use as the disk image for the new guest.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-u\fR \fIUUID\fR, \fB--uuid\fR=\fIUUID\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
UUID for the guest; if none is specified, a random UUID is generated. If
you specify \fIUUID\fR, use a 32-digit hexadecimal number. Keep in mind that
UUIDs are intended to be unique across the entire data center, and indeed,
the world.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRCloning a Guest with a Single Disk
.sp
.LP
The following command clones a guest named \fBdemo\fR, which has a single
disk to copy.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBvirt-clone \e
     --original demo \e
     --name newdemo \e
     --file /var/lib/xen/images/newdemo.img\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRCloning a Guest with Multiple Disks
.sp
.LP
The following command clones a guest named \fBdemo\fR, with has multiple
disks to copy.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBvirt-clone \e
     --original demo \e
     --name newdemo \e
     --file /var/lib/xen/images/newdemo.img \e
     --file /var/lib/xen/images/newdata.img\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRCloning to a Device with Comparable Disk Space
.sp
.LP
The following command clones a guest to a physical device that has at least
as much disk space as had the original guest. . If the destination device is
has more space, the new guest can do a file system resize when it boots.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBvirt-clone \e
     --name demo \e
     --file /dev/HostVG/DemoVM \e
     --mac 00:16:3e:34:11:54\fR
