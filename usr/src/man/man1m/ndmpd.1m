The \fBndmpd\fR daemon handles client Network Data Management Protocol
(NDMP) requests. NDMP is an open, enterprise-wide, network-based data
management protocol used for backup and recovery. The \fBndmpd\fR daemon
enables users to manage data backup and recovery using Data Management
Application (DMA) clients. The NDMP protocol is used to coordinate data
movement and control between a DMA and an NDMP server or between two NDMP
servers.
