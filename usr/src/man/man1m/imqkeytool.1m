.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBimqkeytool\fR utility generates a self-signed certificate for secure
communication. The certificate can be used by a broker instance to establish
a secure connection with a client, or by a Message Queue-supplied
\fBHTTPS\fR servlet to establish a secure connection with a broker instance.
An \fBHTTPS\fR servlet is an SSL-enabled varient of the HyperText Transfer
Protocol that establishes a secure connection with a broker instance.
.sp
.LP
Without an option, \fBimqkeytool\fR generates a self-signed certificate for
a broker instance.
.sp
.LP
\fBimqkeytool\fR uses command line options to specify whether the
certificate is used by a broker instance or by a servlet.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-broker\fR
.ad
.RS 30n
.rt

.rt
Generate a self-signed certificate for an HTTPS servlet and places it in
\fIkeystore_location\fR.
.sp
\fIkeystore_location\fR refers to the location of the keystore. You should
move this keystore to a location where it is accessible and readable by the
Message Queue HTTPS servlet to establish a secure connection with a
broker.
