.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdsbitmap\fR command calculates the size of the Availability Suite bitmap volume required for use with the specified data volume.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n

\fB\fB-p\fR \fB\fIdata_volume\fR\fR \fB[\fIbitmap_volume\fR]\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
For the given \fIdata_volume\fR, \fBdsbitmap\fR calculates and display the required size for the associated Availability Suite Point in Time bitmap volume. The bitmap volume sizes for all possible Availability Suite Point in Time set configurations are displayed. These configurations include Independent shadow, Full size dependent shadow, and Compact dependent shadow. If the optional \fIbitmap_volume\fR argument is supplied, \fBdsbitmap\fR determines if this volume is large enough to be used as the bitmap volume for \fIdata_volume\fR.

.RS 4n
For the given \fIdata_volume\fR, \fBdsbitmap\fR calculates and displays the required size for the associated Availability Suite Remote Mirror bitmap volume. The bitmap volume sizes for all possible Availability Suite Remote Mirror set configurations are displayed. These configurations include Sync replication,  Async replication with memory queue, disk queue and 32 bit refcount.   If the optional \fIbitmap_volume\fR argument is supplied, \fBdsbitmap\fR determines if this volume is large enough to be used as the bitmap volume for \fIdata_volume\fR.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
\fBdsbitmap\fR is typically used by the system administrator during the initial stages of configuring Sun StorageTek Availability Suite software in order to determine the required bitmap volume sizes, and then to check if the bitmap volumes that have been created are suitable.
.SH EXIT STATUS

.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
