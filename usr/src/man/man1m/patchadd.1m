.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpatchadd\fR applies a patch package to a system running the Solaris
2.\fIx\fR operating environment or later Solaris environments (such as
Solaris 10) that are compatible with Solaris 2.\fIx.\fR This patch
installation utility cannot be used to apply Solaris 1 patches.
\fBpatchadd\fR must be run as root.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpatchadd\fR command has the following forms:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The first form of \fBpatchadd\fR installs one or more patches to a system,
client, service, or to the miniroot of a Net Install Image.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The second form of \fBpatchadd\fR displays installed patches on the client,
service, or to the miniroot of a Net Install Image.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Starting with version 10 of the Solaris operating system, \fBpatchadd\fR
performs validity and dependency checking among a collection of patches that
you specify with the \fB-M\fR source specifier. See the description of
\fB-M\fR under OPERANDS, below.
.sp
.LP
With respect to \fBzones\fR(5), when invoked in the global zone, by
default, \fBpatchadd\fR patches all appropriate packages in all zones.
Patching behavior on system with \fBzones\fR installed varies according to
the following factors:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
use of the \fB-G\fR option (described below)
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
setting of the \fBSUNW_PKG_ALLZONES\fR variable in the \fBpkginfo\fR file
(see \fBpkginfo\fR(4))
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
type of zone, global or local (non-global) in \fBpatchadd\fR which is
invoked
.RE
.sp
.LP
The interaction of the factors above is specified in "Interaction of
\fB-G\fR and \fBpkginfo\fR Variable in Zones," below.
.sp
.LP
When you add patches to packages on a Solaris system with zones installed,
you will see numerous zones-related messages, the frequency and content of
which depend on whether you invoke \fBpatchadd\fR in a global or local zone,
the setting of \fBSUNW_PKG_ALLZONES\fR, and the use of the \fB-G\fR
option.
.sp
.LP
The \fIpatch\fR, \fB-M\fR, \fB-C\fR, \fB-R\fR, and \fB-S\fR arguments shown
in the SYNOPSIS are described under OPERANDS, following OPTIONS.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-B\fR \fIbackout_dir\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Saves backout data to a directory other than the package database. Specify
\fIbackout_dir\fR as an absolute path name.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-G\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Add patch(es) to packages in the current zone only. When used in the global
zone, the patch is added to packages in the global zone only and is not
propagated to packages in any existing or yet-to-be-created non-global zone.
When used in a non-global zone, the patch is added to packages in the
non-global zone only. See "Interaction of \fB-G\fR and \fBpkginfo\fR
Variable in Zones,", below.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-k\fR \fIkeystore\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Use \fIkeystore\fR as the location to get trusted certificate authority
certificates when verifying digital signatures found in each patch. If no
keystore is specified, then the default keystore locations are searched for
valid trusted certificates. See \fBKEY STORE LOCATIONS\fR in
\fBpkgadd\fR(1M) for more information.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-n\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Tells \fBpatchadd\fR to ignore the signature and not to validate it. This
should be used only when the content of the patch is known and trusted, and
is primarily included to allow \fBpatchadd\fR to apply a patch on systems
without the ability to verify the patch signature, such as Solaris 8.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-p\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-P\fR \fIpasswd\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Password to use to decrypt the keystore specified with \fB-k\fR, if
required. See \fBPASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\fR in \fBpkgadd\fR(1M) for more
information about the format of this option's argument.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-t\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Maintains the \fBpatchadd\fR return codes from the Solaris release prior to
Solaris 10. On a system with \fBzones\fR(5) installed, a return code of 0
indicates success. Any other return code indicates failure.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-u\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Turns off validation against other required or incompatible patches. Use
extreme caution when using this option. Its use can precipitate
unanticipated bad consequences.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-x\fR \fIproxy\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify a HTTP[S] proxy to use when downloading packages The format of
proxy is \fIhost\fR:\fIport\fR, where \fIhost\fR is the hostname of the
HTTP[S] proxy, and \fIport\fR is the port number associated with the proxy.
This switch overrides all other methods of specifying a proxy. See
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES in \fBpkgadd\fR(1M) for more information on alternate
methods of specifying a default proxy.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.SS "Sources"
.sp
.LP
\fBpatchadd\fR must be supplied a source for retrieving the patch. Specify
sources using the syntax shown below.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIpatch\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The absolute path name to \fIpatch_id\fR or a URI pointing to a signed
patch. \fB/var/sadm/spool/patch/104945-02\fR is an example of a \fIpatch\fR.
\fBhttps://syrinx.eng:8887/patches/104945-02\fR is an example of a URI
pointing to a signed patch.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-M\fR \fIpatch_location\fR [\fIpatch_list\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the patches to be installed by directory location or URL and,
optionally, the name of a file containing a patch list.
.sp
When using a directory as the \fIpatch_location\fR, specify that directory
as an absolute path name. Specify a URL as the server and path name that
contains the spooled patches. The optional \fIpatch_list\fR is the name of
the file at a specified location containing the patches to be installed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-M\fR \fIpatch_location\fR \fIpatch_id\fR [\fIpatch_id\fR.\|.\|.]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the patches to be installed by directory location or URL, and
patch number.
.sp
To use the directory location or URL and the patch number, specify
\fIpatch_location\fR as the absolute path name of the directory that
contains spooled patches. Specify a URL as the server and path name that
contains the spooled patches. Specify \fIpatch_id\fR as the patch number of
a given patch. \fB104945-02\fR is an example of a \fIpatch_id\fR.
\fB104945-02\fR is also an example of a patchid in \fB104945-02.jar\fR.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Note that \fBpatchadd\fR does not require a list of patches. Among a
collection of patches\(emresiding in a directory, specified in a list, or
entered on a command line\(em\fBpatchadd\fR performs validity and dependency
checking. Specifically, the command does the following:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Determines whether a patch is applicable for a system. For example, if the
package to be patched is not installed, \fBpatchadd\fR does not attempt to
add the patch.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Establishes dependencies among valid patches and orders the installation of
patches accordingly.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Most users will find the easiest way to specify a source for \fBpatchadd\fR
is to specify only a \fIpatch_location\fR containing a set of patches.
.SS "Destinations"
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBpatchadd\fR applies a patch to the specified destination. If
no destination is specified, then the current system (the one with its root
filesystem mounted at \fB/\fR) is assumed to be the destination for the
patch. You can specify a destination in the following ways:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-C\fR \fInet_install_image\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Patches the files located on the miniroot on a Net Install Image created by
\fBsetup_install_server\fR. Specify \fInet_install_image\fR as the absolute
path name to a Solaris 8 or compatible version boot directory. See
\fBEXAMPLES\fR.
.sp
You should use the \fB-C\fR option only to install patches that are
recommended for installation to the miniroot. Patches that are recommended
for installation to the miniroot usually include install-related patches
such as package commands, and Sun install and patch installation tools. If
you apply too many patches to the miniroot it can grow too large to fit into
memory during a net installation of Solaris. Use the \fB-B\fR option and the
\fB-C\fR option together so the miniroot does not get too large. See
\fB-B\fR, above.
.sp
Note that in the current release and in certain versions of Solaris 10, the
miniroot is compressed. To determine whether the miniroot is compressed on
your system, look for a file called \fBsparc.miniroot\fR or
\fBx86.miniroot\fR under \fB/boot\fR, on the boot medium. Before you can
patch a compressed miniroot, you must perform certains steps. See "Patching
a Compressed Miniroot" below.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-R\fR \fIclient_root_path\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Locates all patch files generated by \fBpatchadd\fR under the directory
\fIclient_root_path\fR. \fIclient_root_path\fR is the directory that
contains the bootable root of a client from the server's perspective.
Specify \fIclient_root_path\fR as the absolute path name to the beginning of
the directory tree under which all patch files generated by \fBpatchadd\fR
are to be located. \fB-R\fR cannot be specified with the \fB-S\fR option.
See \fBNOTES\fR.
.LP
Note -
.sp
.RS 2
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with
the \fB-R\fR option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file system,
might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the
non-global zone's file system. See \fBzones\fR(5).
.RE
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-S\fR \fIservice\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies an alternate service (for example, \fBSolaris_8\fR). This service
is part of the server and client model, and can only be used from the
server's console. Servers can contain shared \fB/usr\fR file systems that
are created by \fBsmosservice\fR(1M). These service areas can then be made
available to the clients they serve. \fB-S\fR cannot be specified with the
\fB-R\fR option. See \fBNOTES\fR.
.RE

.SS "Patching a Compressed Miniroot"
.sp
.LP
The Solaris operating system uses a compressed miniroot. The compressed
miniroot was adopted first in Solaris for x86 and then in Solaris for SPARC
over the course of Solaris 10 update releases. See below for an easy way to
determine whether your Solaris system uses a compressed miniroot.
.sp
.LP
To patch a system with a compressed miniroot (full or partial), you must
unpack and then repack the miniroot before and after running \fBpatchadd\fR
with the \fB-C\fR destination specifier. Use the procedure shown below and
accompanying example commands.
.RS +4
.TP
1.
Unpack the compressed miniroot:

.RE
.sp
.LP
At this point, you can use \fBsetup_install_server\fR(1M) to install the
patched miniroot on an install server. See \fBroot_archive\fR(1M) for a
description of that command.
.sp
.LP
To determine whether a Solaris image uses a compressed miniroot, check for
the presence of either an \fBx86.miniroot\fR or \fBsparc.miniroot\fR file
under \fB/boot\fR on the boot medium.
.SS "Interaction of \fB-G\fR and \fBpkginfo\fR Variable in Zones"

There is insufficient space in the \fB/var/sadm/patch\fR directory to save
old files. The user has three options for handling this problem: Use the
\fB-B\fR option while invoking \fBpatchadd\fR. This option will direct
\fBpatchadd\fR to: save the backout data to the user specified file system,
generate additional disk space by deleting unneeded files, or override the
saving of the old files by using the \fB-d\fR (do not save) option when
running \fBpatchadd\fR.
.sp
If the user elects not to save the old versions of the files to be patched,
\fBpatchrm\fR \fBcannot\fR be used. One way to regain space on a system is
to remove the save area for previously applied patches. Once the user has
decided that it is unlikely that a patch will be backed out, the user can
remove the files that were saved by \fBpatchadd\fR. The following commands
should be executed to remove the saved files for \fBpatch\fIpatch_id\fR:

Before applying the patch, the patch installation script uses \fBcpio\fR to
save the old versions of the files to be patched. This error message means
that the \fBcpio\fR failed. The output of the \fBcpio\fR would have been
preceded this message. The user should take the appropriate action to
correct the \fBcpio\fR failure. A common reason for failure will be
insufficient disk space to save the old versions of the files. The user has
two options for handling insufficient disk space: (1) generate additional
disk space by deleting unneeded files, or (2) override the saving of the old
files by using the \fB-d\fR option when running \fBpatchadd\fR. However if

Any patch to one of the architecture-specific packages might contain one
element for each of the possible architectures. For example, assume you are

\fBSUNWcar\fR, you would see the following (or similar) messages:

To successfully install a patch to a client or server, \fBpatchadd\fR must
be issued twice, once with the \fB-R\fR option and once with the \fB-S\fR
option. This guarantees that the patch is installed to both the \fB/usr\fR
and \fBroot\fR partitions. This is necessary if there are both \fB/usr\fR
and \fBroot\fR packages in the patch.
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgadd\fR is invoked by \fBpatchadd\fR and executes the installation
scripts in the \fIpkg\fR/install\fR directory. The \fBcheckinstall\fR
script is executed with its ownership set to user \fBinstall\fR, if there is
no user \fBinstall\fR then \fBpkgadd\fR executes the \fBcheckinstall\fR
script as noaccess. The SVR4 \fBABI\fR states that the \fBcheckinstall\fR
shall only be used as an information gathering script. If the permissions
for the \fBcheckinstall\fR script are changed to something other than the
initial settings, \fBpkgadd\fR may not be able to open the file for reading,
thus causing the patch installation to abort with the following error:

Deferred activation patching requires the loopback file system (\fBlofs\fR)
in order to complete safely. Systems running Sun Cluster 3.1 or Sun Cluster
3.2 are likely to have \fBlofs\fR turned off because of restrictions on
HA-NFS functionality when \fBlofs\fR is enabled. Therefore, before a
deferred activation patch is installed or removed, you must re-enable the
loopback file system by commenting out the following line in the
\fB/etc/system\fR file:
