.SH NAME
slpd \- Service Location Protocol Daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/inet/slpd\fR [\fB-f\fR \fIconfiguration-file\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B slpd
daemon provides common server functionality for the Service
Location Protocol ("\fBSLP\fR") versions 1 and 2, as defined by \fBIETF\fR
in
.I "RFC 2165"
and
.IR "RFC 2608" .
\fBSLP\fR provides a scalable
framework for the discovery and selection of network services.
.sp
.LP
\fBslpd\fR provides the following framework services:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B Directory Agent
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This service automatically caches service advertisements from service
agents to provide them to user agents, and makes directory agent
advertisements of its services. This service is optional.
.B slpd
does
not provide directory agent service by default. Directory agents are not
databases, and they do not need to be maintained.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B Service Agent Server
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
All service agents on the local host register and deregister with this
server. This service responds to all requests for services, and forwards
registrations to directory agents. By default,
.B slpd
is a service agent
server.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBPassive Directory Agent Discovery\fR 
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This service listens for directory agent advertisements and maintains a
table of active directory agents.  When a user agent wishes to discover a
directory agent, it can simply query
.BR slpd ,
obviating the need to
perform discovery by means of multicast. By default,
.B slpd
performs
this service.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B Proxy Registration
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This service can act as a proxy service agent for services that cannot
register themselves.
.B slpd
reads the proxy registration file for
information on services it is to proxy. By default, no services are
registered by proxy.
.RE

.sp
.LP
All configuration options are available from the configuration file.
\fBslpd\fR reads its configuration file upon startup.
.sp
.LP
Stop and start the slpd daemon using
.BR svcadm "(1M).  Use the command"
\fBsvcadm enable network/slp\fR to start the slpd daemon.  Use the command
\fBsvcadm disable network/slp\fR to stop it.
.sp
.LP
The file \fB/etc/inet/slp.conf\fR must exist before the
.B slp
service
can start the daemon. Only the example file \fB/etc/inet/slp.conf.example\fR
is present by default. To enable
.BR SLP ,
copy
\fB/etc/inet/slp.conf.example\fR to \fB/etc/inet/slp.conf\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-f\fR \fIconfiguration-file\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
Specify an alternate configuration file
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1\fR Stopping the \fBslpd\fR daemon
.sp
.LP
The following command stops the
.B slpd
daemon:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# svcadm disable network/slp
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2\fR Restarting the \fBslpd\fR daemon
.sp
.LP
The following command restarts the
.B slpd
daemon:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# svcadm restart network/slp
.fi
.in -2
.sp
