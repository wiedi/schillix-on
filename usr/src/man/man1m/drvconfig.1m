.TH drvconfig 1M "9 Aug 2004" "SunOS 5.11" "System Administration Commands"
.SH NAME
drvconfig \- apply permission and ownership changes to devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBdrvconfig\fR [\fB-bn\fR] [\fB-a\fR \fIalias_name\fR] [\fB-c\fR \fIclass_name\fR]
     [\fB-i\fR \fIdrivername\fR] [\fB-m\fR \fImajor_num\fR] [\fB-r\fR \fIroot_dir\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdevfsadm\fR(1M) is now the preferred command and should be used instead
of \fBdrvconfig\fR.
.sp
.LP
The default operation of \fBdrvconfig\fR is to apply permission and
ownership changes to devices. Normally, this command is run automatically
after a new driver has been installed (with \fBadd_drv\fR(1M)) and the
system has been rebooted.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-a\fIalias_name\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Add the name \fIalias_name\fR to the list of aliases that this driver is
known by. This option, if used, must be used with the \fB-m\fR
\fImajor_num\fR, the \fB-b\fR and the \fB-i\fR \fIdrivername\fR options.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-b\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Add a new major number to name binding into the kernel's internal
\fBname_to_major\fR tables. This option is not normally used directly, but
is used by other utilities such as \fBadd_drv\fR(1M). Use of the \fB-b\fR
option requires that \fB-i\fR and \fB-m\fR be used also. No \fB/devices\fR
entries are created.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-c\fIclass_name\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The driver being added to the system exports the class \fIclass_name\fR.
This option is not normally used directly, but is used by other utilities.
It is only effective when used with the \fB-b\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-i\fIdrivername\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Only configure the devices for the named driver. The following options are
used by the implementation of \fBadd_drv\fR(1M) and \fBrem_drv\fR(1M), and
may not be supported in future versions of Solaris:
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-m\fImajor_num\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Specify the major number \fImajor_num\fR for this driver to add to the
kernel's \fBname_to_major\fR binding tables.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-n\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Do not try to load and attach any drivers, or if the \fB-i\fR option is
given, do not try to attach the driver named \fIdrivername\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-r\fIroot_dir\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Perform operations under \fIroot_dir\fR, rather than directly under
\fBroot\fR.
