.SH NAME
ftpconfig \- set up anonymous FTP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBftpconfig\fR [\fIftpdir\fR]
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBftpconfig\fR \fB-d\fR \fIftpdir\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBftpconfig\fR script is executed by the super user to set up anonymous FTP. Anonymous FTP allows users to remotely log on to the FTP server by specifying the user name  \fBftp\fR or \fBanonymous\fR and the user's email  address as password. The anonymous users are logged on to the FTP Server and given access to a restricted file area with its own file system root. See \fBchroot\fR(2). The FTP area has  its own minimal system files.
.sp
.LP
This command will copy and set up all the components needed to operate an anonymous FTP server, including creating the \fIftp\fR user account, creating device nodes, copying \fB/usr/lib\fR files, and copying timezone data.  The \fBpasswd\fR and \fBgroup\fR files set up have been stripped down to prevent malicious users from finding login names on the server.  The anonymous file area will be placed under \fBftpdir\fR. If the \fIftp\fR user account already exists, then the current FTP area is used, and the system files in it are updated. All other files are left untouched. This command should be run to update the anonymous FTP area's configuration whenever a system patch is installed, or the system is upgraded.
