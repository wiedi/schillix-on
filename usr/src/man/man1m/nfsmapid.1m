.SH NAME
nfsmapid \- NFS user and group id mapping daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/nfs/nfsmapid\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnfsmapid\fR daemon maps to and from NFS version 4 \fBowner\fR and \fBowner_group\fR identification attributes and local \fBUID\fR and \fBGID\fR numbers used by both the NFS version 4 client and server.
.sp
.LP
\fBnfsmapid\fR uses the \fBpasswd\fR and \fBgroup\fR entries in the \fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR file to direct how it performs the mappings.
.sp
.LP
The \fBnfsmapid\fR daemon has no external, customer-accessible interfaces. You can, however, administratively configure \fBnfsmapid\fR in one of the following ways:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Specify the \fBNFSMAPID_DOMAIN\fR parameter in \fBnfs\fR(4)
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Specify the \fB_nfsv4idmapdomain\fR DNS resource record.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBnfsmapid\fR service is managed by the service management facility, \fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/nfs/mapid
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). The service's status can be queried using the \fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
.sp
.LP
If it is disabled, it will be enabled by \fBmount_nfs\fR(1M), \fBshare_nfs\fR(1M), and \fBautomountd\fR(1M), unless  its       \fBapplication/auto_enable\fR property is set to \fBfalse\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBnfsmapid\fR caches a user's UID and GID. If a user subsequently changes a UID or GID, using one of the utilities listed below, the \fBnfsmapid\fR cache becomes stale. At this point, any NFS operation that gets or set attributes will result in the exchange of this stale information. To resolve this situation, restart \fBnfsmapid\fR, as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBsvcadm restart svc:/network/nfs/mapid:default\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The utilities that allow you to change UID and GID are:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBusermod\fR(1M)

The \fBnfsmapid\fR daemon might not exist in a future release of Solaris.
