.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
When used with no arguments, \fBshareall\fR shares all resources from
\fBfile\fR, which contains a list of \fBshare\fR command lines. If the
operand is a hyphen (\(mi), then the \fBshare\fR command lines are obtained
from the standard input. Otherwise, if neither a \fBfile\fR nor a hyphen is
specified, then the file \fB/etc/dfs/dfstab\fR is used as the default.
.sp
.LP
Resources may be shared by specific file system types by specifying the
file systems in a comma-separated list as an argument to \fB-F\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBunshareall\fR unshares all currently shared resources. Without a
\fB-F\fR flag, it unshares resources for all distributed file system
types.
