.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The Local Manageability Service, \fBlms\fR, allows applications to access
the Intel Active Management Technology (Intel AMT) ME (Management Engine)
using the local HECI interface. LMS is dependent on the HECI driver.
.sp
.LP
To use \fBlms\fR, ensure that the Intel AMT Manageability Interface driver
is installed and connected to the ME.
.sp
.LP
\fBlms\fR is intended to be run as a daemon. Messages from the service are
sent to the \fBsyslog\fR. LMS messages are marked with a source of
\fB"LMS"\fR. 
.sp
.LP
For an example of how to enable the LMS service using SMF, see
\fBEXAMPLES\fR.
