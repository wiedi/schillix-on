.SH NAME
fdetach \- detach a name from a STREAMS-based file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBfdetach\fR \fIpath\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfdetach\fR command detaches a \fBSTREAMS-based\fR file descriptor
from a name in the file system. Use the
.I path
operand to specify the
path name of the object in the file system name space, which was previously
attached. See \fBfattach\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
The user must be the owner of the file or a user with the appropriate
privileges. All subsequent operations on
.I path
will operate on the
underlying file system entry and not on the
.B STREAMS
file. The
permissions and status of the entry are restored to the state they were in
before the
.B STREAMS
file was attached to the entry.
