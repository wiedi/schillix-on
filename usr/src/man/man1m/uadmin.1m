.SH NAME
uadmin \- administrative control
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fB/sbin/uadmin\fR \fIcmd\fR \fIfcn\fR [\fImdep\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBuadmin\fR command provides control for basic administrative
functions. This command is tightly coupled to the system administration
procedures and is not intended for general use. It may be invoked only by
the super-user.
.sp
.LP
Both the \fIcmd\fR (command) and \fIfcn\fR (function) arguments are
converted to integers and passed to the \fBuadmin\fR system call. The
optional \fImdep\fR (machine dependent) argument is only available for the
\fIcmd\fR values of \fB1\fR (\fBA_REBOOT\fR), \fB2\fR (\fBA_SHUTDOWN\fR), or
\fB5\fR (\fBA_DUMP\fR). For any other \fIcmd\fR value, no \fImdep\fR
command-line argument is allowed.
.sp
.LP
When passing an \fImdep\fR value that contains whitespaces, the string must
be grouped together as a single argument enclosed within quotes, for
example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
uadmin 1 1 "\fB-s\fR kernel/unix"
.fi
.in -2
