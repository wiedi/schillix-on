.SH NAME
mmsinit \- initialize MMS services
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/mmsinit\fR \fB-t\fR \fIserver\fR [\fB-o\fR \fIoptionname\fR=\fIvalue\fR [\fB-o\fR \fIoptionname2\fR=\fIvalue\fR].\|.\|.]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmmsinit\fR command initializes the Media Management System (MMS)
environment and enables MMS services. An MMS server runs the Media
Management (MM) daemon, which controls access to MMS-managed storage
resources, and hosts the MMS database. Run this command once to start MMS
services with the specified attributes. To change the attributes after this
command has been invoked, use the \fBmmsadm\fR(1M) command.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmmsinit\fR command requires the \fB-t\fR \fIserver\fR argument, to
specify the server on which MMS services will run.
.sp
.LP
To run \fBmmsinit\fR, you must become superuser, or assume the Primary
Administrator role.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-o\fR \fIoptionname\fR=\fIvalue\fR.\|.\|.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify one or more of the options and values listed below.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBlog-level\fR=\fBemergency\fR|\fBalert\fR|\fBcritical\fR|\fBerror\fR|\fBwarning\fR|\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fBnotice\fR|\fBinformation\fR|\fBdebug\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Sets the severity level of messages to be included in the log file. Default
level is \fBerror\fR, logging all error messages.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBnum-restarts\fR=\fInum\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the number of attempts to start a failed daemon before the drive
or library associated with the daemon is disabled and requires the \fBmmsadm
online\fR command to be run after the problem with the system or device is
resolved. Use a value of \fB-1\fR for unlimited restart attempts. The
default value is \fB3\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBattended\fR=\fByes\fR|\fBno\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify whether MMS makes operator requests when an operation cannot be
automatically satisfied. An example of such a case would be if a mount
request was made for a tape volume that had been physically removed from a
library. The default action, \fByes\fR, indicates that an operator is
available to respond.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBnum-sockets\fR=\fInum\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the number of open file descriptors the MM daemon can have at one
time. On a resource-constrained system, set this value to a number between
30 and 65536. It is not recommended to set the value to less than 256. The
default value is \fB-1\fR, which sets number of file descriptors to the
maximum supported.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBdisk-timeout\fR=\fIseconds\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the time a disk archiving drive manager waits for the file system
containing a disk archiving volume to become available. It is strongly
recommended to set the time to a minimum of 120 seconds (two minutes). Use a
value of \fB0\fR to specify no expiration time.
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-P\fR \fIpasswordfile\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Path to a file containing the MMS administrative password. If this option
is not specified, the user will be prompted for the password. A password
must contain at least eight characters.
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB0\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Successful completion.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB!=0\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
An error occurred.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
When MMS is added to the Automated Cartridge System Library Software
(ACSLS) environment, the ACSLS configuration must be modified to allow them
to work together. See the procedure for performing these modifications at
the OpenSolaris web site for MMS:
