.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdig\fR utility (domain information groper) is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers. It performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queried. Most DNS administrators use \fBdig\fR to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use and clarity of output. Other lookup tools tend to have less functionality than \fBdig\fR.
.sp
.LP
Although \fBdig\fR is normally used with command-line arguments, it also has a batch mode of operation for reading lookup requests from a file. A brief summary of its command-line arguments and options is printed when the \fB-h\fR option is specified. Unlike earlier versions, the BIND 9 implementation of \fBdig\fR allows multiple lookups to be issued from the command line.
.sp
.LP
Unless it is told to query a specific name server, \fBdig\fR tries each of the servers listed in \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fR.
.sp
.LP
When no command line arguments or options are given, \fBdig\fR performs an NS query for "." (the root).
.sp
.LP
It is possible to set per-user defaults for \fBdig\fR with \fB${HOME}/.digrc\fR. This file is read and any options in it are applied before the command line arguments.
.sp
.LP
The \fBIN\fR and \fBCH\fR class names overlap with the \fBIN\fR and \fBCH\fR top level domains names. Either use the \fB-t\fR and \fB-c\fR options to specify the type and class, or use \fB"IN."\fR and \fB"CH."\fR when looking up these top level domains.
.SS "Simple Usage"
.sp
.LP
The following is a typical invocation of \fBdig\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
dig @server name type 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIserver\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The name or IP address of the name server to query. This can be an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in colon-delimited notation. When the supplied \fIserver\fR argument is a hostname, \fBdig\fR resolves that name before querying that name server. If no \fIserver\fR argument is provided, \fBdig\fR consults \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fR and queries the name servers listed there. The reply from the name server that responds is displayed.

The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-4\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR \fIaddress\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Set the source IP address of the query to \fIaddress\fR. This must be a valid address on one of the host's network interfaces or \fB0.0.0.0\fR or \fB::\fR. An optional port may be specified by appending: \fB#\fR\fI<port>\fR
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIclass\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Override the default query class (IN for internet). The \fIclass\fR argument is any valid class, such as HS for Hesiod records or CH for CHAOSNET records.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIfilename\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Operate in batch mode by reading a list of lookup requests to process from the file \fIfilename\fR. The file contains a number of queries, one per line. Each entry in the file should be organized in the same way they would be presented as queries to \fBdig\fR using the command-line interface.

\fB\fB-p\fR \fIport#\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Query a non-standard port number. The \fIport#\fR argument is the port number that \fBdig\fR sends its queries instead of the standard DNS port number 53. This option tests a name server that has been configured to listen for queries on a non-standard port number.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR \fItype\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Set the query type to \fItype\fR, which can be any valid query type supported in BIND9. The default query type "A", unless the \fB-x\fR option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup. A zone transfer can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR. When an incremental zone transfer (IXFR) is required, \fItype\fR is set to \fBixfr\fR=\fIN\fR. The incremental zone transfer will contain the changes made to the zone since the serial number in the zone's SOA record was \fIN\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR \fIaddr\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Simplify reverse lookups (mapping addresses to names ). The \fIaddr\fR argument is an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation, or a colon-delimited IPv6 address. When this option is used, there is no need to provide the \fIname\fR, \fIclass\fR and \fItype\fR arguments. The \fBdig\fR utility automatically performs a lookup for a name like \fB11.12.13.10.in-addr.arpa\fR and sets the query type and class to PTR and IN, respectively. By default, IPv6 addresses are looked up using nibble format under the IP6.ARPA domain. To use the older RFC1886 method using the IP6.INT domain, specify the \fB-i\fR option. Bit string labels (RFC 2874) are now experimental and are not attempted.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-y\fR \fIname\fR:\fIkey\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Specify a transaction signature (TSIG) key on the command line. This is done to sign the DNS queries sent by \fBdig\fR, as well as their responses. You can also specify the TSIG key itself on the command line using the \fB-y\fR option. The \fIname\fR argument is the name of the TSIG key and the \fIkey\fR argument is the actual key. The key is a base-64 encoded string, typically generated by \fBdnssec-keygen\fR(1M). Caution should be taken when using the \fB-y\fR option on multi-user systems, since the key can be visible in the output from \fBps\fR(1) or in the shell's history file. When using TSIG authentication with \fBdig\fR, the name server that is queried needs to know the key and algorithm that is being used. In BIND, this is done by providing appropriate \fBkey\fR and \fBserver\fR statements in \fBnamed.conf\fR.
.RE

.SH QUERY OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The \fBdig\fR utility provides a number of query options which affect the way in which lookups are made and the results displayed. Some of these set or reset flag bits in the query header, some determine which sections of the answer get printed, and others determine the timeout and retry strategies.
.sp
.LP
Each query option is identified by a keyword preceded by a plus sign (+). Some keywords set or reset an option. These may be preceded by the string no to negate the meaning of that keyword. Other keywords assign values to options like the timeout interval. They have the form \fB+keyword=\fR\fIvalue\fR. The query options are:

.SH MULTIPLE QUERIES
.sp
.LP
The BIND 9 implementation of \fBdig\fR supports specifying multiple queries on the command line (in addition to supporting the \fB-f\fR batch file option). Each of those queries can be supplied with its own set of flags, options and query options.
.sp
.LP
In this case, each \fIquery\fR argument represent an individual query in the command-line syntax described above. Each consists of any of the standard options and flags, the name to be looked up, an optional query type, and class and any query options that should be applied to that query.
.sp
.LP
A global set of query options, which should be applied to all queries, can also be supplied. These global query options must precede the first tuple of name, class, type, options, flags, and query options supplied on the command line. Any global query options (except the \fB+[no]cmd\fR option) can be overridden by a query-specific set of query options. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
dig +qr www.isc.org any -x 127.0.0.1 isc.org ns +noqr
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\&...shows how \fBdig\fR could be used from the command line to make three lookups: an ANY query for \fBwww.isc.org\fR, a reverse lookup of 127.0.0.1 and a query for the NS records of \fBisc.org\fR. A global query option of \fB+qr\fR is applied, so that \fBdig\fR shows the initial query it made for each lookup. The final query has a local query option of \fB+noqr\fR which means that \fBdig\fR will not print the initial query when it looks up the NS records for \fBisc.org\fR.
