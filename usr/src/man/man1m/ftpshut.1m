.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBftpshut\fR command provides an automated shutdown procedure that the
superuser can use to notify FTP users when the FTP Server is shutting
down.
.sp
.LP
Ten minutes before shutdown, or immediately if the value of
.I time
is
less than ten minutes, any new FTP Server connections will be disabled. You
may adjust the shutdown of new FTP Server connections by means of the
\fB-l\fR option.
.sp
.LP
 Five minutes before shutdown, or immediately if the value of
.I time
is less than five minutes, all current FTP connections will be disconnected. You may adjust the shutdown of current FTP connections by means of the
.B -d
option.
.sp
.LP
 The \fBftpshut\fR command creates shutdown message files that the FTP Server uses to determine when to shutdown. Separate shutdown message files are created in the anonymous and virtual host FTP Server areas, in addition to the system wide shutdown message file. Once the shutdown occurs, the server continues to refuse connections until the appropriate shutdown message file is removed. This normally is done by using the \fBftprestart\fR(1M) command. The location of the shutdown message file is specified by the \fBshutdown\fR capability in the \fBftpaccess\fR file.

The \fBftpshut\fR command supports the following operands:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.I time
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt
The
.I time
at which \fBftpshut\fR will bring the FTP Servers down.
\fItime\fR can have a value of
.BR now ,
which indicates an immediate
shutdown. Alternatively,
.I time
can specify a future time in one of two
formats: \fB+\fInumber\fR or \fIHHMM\fR. The first form brings the FTP
Server down in
.I number
minutes. The second brings the FTP Server down
at the time of day indicated, using a 24-hour clock format. When using the
absolute time format, you can only specify times between now and 23:59.

.ne 2
.mk
.na

.ad
.RS 19n
.rt

\fIwarning-message\fR will be formatted at 70 characters wide. \fBftpshut\fR
