.SH NAME
smtnrhdb \- manage entries in the tnrhdb database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sadm/bin/smtnrhdb\fR \fIsubcommand\fR [\fIauth_args\fR] \fB--\fR \fIsubcommand_args\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsmtnrhdb\fR command adds, modifies, deletes, and lists entries in the \fBtnrhdb\fR database.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtnrhdb\fR database specifies which remote-host template to use for each host, including the local host, in the distributed system. If a host's  IP  address cannot be matched to some entry in the \fBtnrhdb\fR database, communication with the host is not permitted.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsmtnrhdb\fR command requires the Solaris Management Console to be initialized for the command to succeed (see \fBsmc\fR(1M)). After rebooting the Solaris Management Console server, the first \fBsmc\fR connection can time out, so you might need to retry the command.
.SS "Valid Host Addresses and Wildcards"
.sp
.LP
The trusted network software uses a network "longest prefix of matching bits" mechanism when looking for a host. The software looks first for the IP address of the host. If the software does not find this address, then the software falls back to searching for an IP address with the longest prefix of a matching bit pattern, and so on.
.LP
Note - 
.sp
.RS 2
The actual numeric value of the subnet  address or other subnetting  information on the system (for example, from the \fBnetmasks\fR(4)  file)  are  not considered by this mechanism.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Using the "longest prefix of matching bits" mechanism, an IPv4 address of 0.0.0.0 is a wildcard address with a prefix length of 0 and hence matches any IPv4 address. For more information about prefi x lengths in IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, see \fISystem Administration Guide: IP Services\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsmtnrhdb\fR command accepts a hostname, IP address, and wildcard address with as optional prefix as valid addresses. See \fIsubcommand_args\fR, below, for the format of valid addresses.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The \fBsmtnrhdb\fR authentication arguments, \fIauth_args\fR, are derived from the \fBsmc\fR arg set. These arguments are the same regardless of which subcommand you use.
.sp
.LP
The subcommand-specific options, \fIsubcommand_args\fR, must be preceded by the \fB--\fR option.
.SS "\fIauth_args\fR"
.sp
.LP
The valid \fIauth_args\fR are \fB-D\fR, \fB-H\fR, \fB-l\fR, \fB-p\fR, \fB-r\fR, and \fB-u\fR; they are all optional. If no \fIauth_args\fR are specified, certain defaults will be assumed and the user might be prompted for additional information, such as a password for authentication purposes. These letter options can also be specified by their equivalent option words preceded by a double dash. For example, you can use either \fB-D\fR or \fB--domain\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-D\fR | \fB--domain\fR \fIdomain\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the default domain that you want to manage. The syntax of \fIdomain\fR=\fItype\fR:/\fIhost_name\fR/\fIdomain_name\fR, where \fItype\fR is \fBdns\fR, \fBldap\fR, or \fBfile\fR; \fIhost_name\fR is the name of the server; and \fIdomain_name\fR is the name of the domain you want to manage.
.sp
If you do not specify this option, the Solaris Management Console assumes the \fBfile\fR default domain on whatever server you choose to manage, meaning that changes are local to the server. Toolboxes can change the domain on a tool-by-tool basis; this option specifies the domain for all other tools.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-H\fR | \fB--hostname\fR \fIhost_name:port\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the \fIhost_name\fR and \fIport\fR to which you want to connect. If you do not specify a \fIport\fR, the system connects to the default port, \fB898\fR. If you do not specify \fIhost_name:port\fR, the Solaris Management Console connects to the local host on port \fB898\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR | \fB--rolepassword\fR \fIrole_password\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the password for the \fIrole_name\fR. If you specify a \fIrole_name\fR but do not specify a \fIrole_password\fR, the system prompts you to supply a \fIrole_password\fR. Passwords specified on the command line can be seen by any user on the system, hence this option is considered insecure.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR | \fB--password\fR \fIpassword\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the password for the \fIuser_name\fR. If you do not specify a password, the system prompts you for one. Passwords specified on the command line can be seen by any user on the system, hence this option is considered insecure.

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR | \fB--rolename\fR \fIrole_name\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR | \fB--username\fR \fIuser_name\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB--\fR\fR

\fB\fB-i\fR \fIipaddress\fR\fR

.sp

\fB\fB-p\fR \fIprefixlen\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the prefix length (in bits) of a wildcard representation of the IP address. The prefix is the left-most portion of the IP address. This option is valid only with the \fB-w\fR option. For example, when the value of \fB-w\fR \fIipaddress-wildcard\fR is 192.168.0.0, a \fIprefixlen\fR value of 24 indicates that the wildcard matches all addresses on the 192.168.0 network. With a \fIprefixlen\fR of 32, the wildcard 192.168.0.0 matches all addresses on the 192.168.0.0 network.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRSpecifying the Template Name for a Wildcard IP Address
.sp
.LP
The admin role specifies the template name, \fBcipso_lan\fR, for a series of hosts that use the IP address wildcard \fB192.168.113.0\fR on the local file system. Since no authorization arguments were specified, the administrator connects to port 898 of the local host on the local server with the file domain type, which are the defaults. The administrator is prompted for the admin password.

.sp
.in +2

$ \fBusr/sadm/bin/smtnrhdb add -- -w 192.168.113.0 -n cipso_lan\fR

\fBExample 2 \fRDeleting an Entry in the \fBtnrhdb\fR Database
.sp
.LP
The admin role connects to port 898 (which happens to be the default) of the LDAP server and deletes a host entry from the database by specifying its IP address, \fB192.168.113.8\fR. Since the domain was not specified, the file domain type and local server are used by default. The administrator is prompted for the admin password.
