.SH NAME
passmgmt \- password files management
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBpassmgmt\fR \fB-a\fR \fIoptions\fR \fIname\fR

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpassmgmt\fR command updates information in the password files. This
command works with both \fB/etc/passwd\fR and \fB/etc/shadow\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBpassmgmt\fR \fB-a\fR adds an entry for user \fIname\fR to the password
files. This command does not create any directory for the new user and the
new login remains locked (with the string \fB*LK*\fR in the password field)
until the \fBpasswd\fR(1) command is executed to set the password.
.sp
.LP
\fBpassmgmt\fR \fB-m\fR modifies the entry for user \fIname\fR in the
password files. The name field in the \fB/etc/shadow\fR entry and all the
fields (except the password field) in the \fB/etc/passwd\fR entry can be
modified by this command. Only fields entered on the command line will be
modified.
.sp
.LP
\fBpassmgmt\fR \fB-d\fR deletes the entry for user \fIname\fR from the
password files. It will not remove any files that the user owns on the
system; they must be removed manually.
.sp
.LP
\fBpassmgmt\fR can be used only by the super-user.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-c\fR \fIcomment\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
A short description of the login, enclosed in quotes. It is limited to a
maximum of 128 characters and defaults to an empty field.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-e\fR \fIexpire\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Specify the expiration date for a login. After this date, no user will be
able to access this login. The expire option argument is a date entered
using one of the date formats included in the template file
\fB/etc/datemsk\fR. See \fBgetdate\fR(3C).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-f\fR \fIinactive\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The maximum number of days allowed between uses of a login ID before that
\fBID\fR is declared invalid. Normal values are positive integers. A value
of \fB0\fR defeats the status.
.sp
Changing the password reactivates an account for the inactivity period.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-g\fR \fIgid\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
\fBGID\fR of \fIname\fR. This number must range from 0 to the maximum
non-negative value for the system. The default is 1.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-h\fR \fIhomedir\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Home directory of \fIname\fR. It is limited to a maximum of 256 characters
and defaults to \fB/usr/\fIname\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-K\fR \fIkey=value\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Set a \fIkey=value\fR pair. See \fBuser_attr\fR(4), \fBauth_attr\fR(4), and
\fBprof_attr\fR(4). The valid \fIkey=value\fR pairs are defined in
\fBuser_attr\fR(4), but the "type" key is subject to the \fBusermod\fR(1M)
and \fBrolemod\fR(1M) restrictions. Multiple \fIkey=value\fR pairs may be
added with multiple \fB-K\fR options.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-k\fR \fIskel_dir\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
A directory that contains skeleton information (such as \fB\&.profile\fR)
that can be copied into a new user's home directory. This directory must
already exist. The system provides the \fB/etc/skel\fR directory that can be
used for this purpose.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-l\fR \fIlogname\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
This option changes the \fIname\fR to \fIlogname\fR. It is used only with
the \fB-m\fR option. The total size of each login entry is limited to a
maximum of 511 bytes in each of the password files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-o\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
This option allows a \fBUID\fR to be non-unique. It is used only with the
\fB-u\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-s\fR \fIshell\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Login shell for \fIname\fR. It should be the full pathname of the program
that will be executed when the user logs in. The maximum size of \fIshell\fR
is 256 characters. The default is for this field to be empty and to be
interpreted as \fB/usr/bin/sh\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-u\fR \fIuid\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
\fBUID\fR of the \fIname\fR. This number must range from 0 to the maximum
non-negative value for the system. It defaults to the next available
\fBUID\fR greater than 99. Without the \fB-o\fR option, it enforces the
uniqueness of a \fBUID.\fR

.RE

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Do not use a colon (\fB:\fR) or \fBRETURN\fR as part of an argument. It is
interpreted as a field separator in the password file. The \fBpassmgmt\fR
command will be removed in a future release. Its functionality has been
replaced and enhanced by \fBuseradd\fR, \fBuserdel\fR, and \fBusermod\fR.
These commands are currently available.
.sp
.LP
This command only modifies password definitions in the local
\fB/etc/passwd\fR and \fB/etc/shadow\fR files. If a network nameservice such
as \fBNIS\fR or \fBNIS+\fR is being used to supplement the local files with
additional entries, \fBpassmgmt\fR cannot change information supplied by the
network nameservice.
