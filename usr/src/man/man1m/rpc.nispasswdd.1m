.SH NAME
rpc.nispasswdd, nispasswdd \- NIS+ password update daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fB/usr/sbin/rpc.nispasswdd\fR [\fB-a\fR \fIattempts\fR] [\fB-c\fR \fIminutes\fR] [\fB-D\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBrpc.nispasswdd\fR daemon is an \fBONC+ RPC\fR service that services
password update requests from \fBnispasswd\fR(1) and \fByppasswd\fR(1). It
updates password entries in the NIS+ \fBpasswd\fR table.
.sp
.LP
\fBrpc.nispasswdd\fR is normally started from a system startup script after
the NIS+ server (\fBrpc.nisd\fR(1M)) has been started. \fBrpc.nispasswdd\fR
will determine whether it is running on a machine that is a master server
for one or more NIS+ directories. If it discovers that the host is not a
master server, then it will promptly exit. It will also determine if
\fBrpc.nisd\fR(1M) is running in NIS (YP) compatibility mode (the
\fB-Y\fRoption) and will register as \fByppasswdd\fR for NIS (YP) clients as
well.
.sp
.LP
\fBrpc.nispasswdd\fR will syslog all failed password update attempts, which
will allow an administrator to determine whether someone was trying to
"crack" the passwords.
.sp
.LP
\fBrpc.nispasswdd\fR has to be run by a superuser.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-a\fR \fIattempts\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Set the maximum number of attempts allowed to authenticate the caller
within a password update request session. Failed attempts are
\fBsyslogd\fR(1M) and the request is cached by the daemon. After the maximum
number of allowed attempts the daemon severs the connection to the client.
The default value is set to \fB3\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB-c\fR \fIminutes\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
Set the number of minutes a failed password update request should be cached
by the daemon. This is the time during which if the daemon receives further
password update requests for the same user and authentication of the caller
fails, then the daemon will simply not respond. The default value is set to
\fB30\fRminutes.

Generate \fBDES\fR credential. By default the \fBDES\fR credential is not
generated for the user if they do not have one. By specifying this option,
if the user does not have a credential, then one will be generated for them
and stored in the NIS+ cred table.
