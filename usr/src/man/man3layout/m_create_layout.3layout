.SH NAME
m_create_layout \- initialize a layout object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -llayout [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <sys/layout.h>



\fBLayoutObject\fR \fBm_create_layout\fR(\fBconst AttrObject\fR \fIattrobj\fR,
     \fB const char*\fR\fImodifier\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBm_create_layout()\fR function creates a \fBLayoutObject\fR associated
with the locale identified by \fIattrobj\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBLayoutObject\fR is an opaque object containing all the data and
methods necessary to perform the layout operations on context-dependent or
directional characters of the locale identified by the \fIattrobj\fR. The
memory for the \fBLayoutObject\fR is allocated by \fBm_create_layout()\fR. The
\fBLayoutObject\fR created has default layout values. If the \fImodifier\fR
argument is not \fINULL\fR, the layout values specified by the \fImodifier\fR
overwrite the default layout values associated with the locale.  Internal
states maintained by the layout transformation function across transformations
are set to their initial values.
.sp
.LP
The \fIattrobj\fR argument is or may be an amalgam of many opaque objects. A
locale object is just one example of the type of object that can be attached
to an attribute object. The \fIattrobj\fR argument specifies a name that is
usually associated with a locale category. If \fIattrobj\fR is \fINULL\fR, the
created \fBLayoutObject\fR is associated with the current locale as set by the
\fBsetlocale\fR(3C) function.
.sp
.LP
The \fImodifier\fR argument announces a set of layout values when the
\fBLayoutObject\fR is created.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBm_create_layout()\fR function returns a
\fBLayoutObject\fR for use in subsequent calls to \fBm_*_layout()\fR
functions. Otherwise the \fBm_create_layout()\fR function returns
(\fBLayoutObject\fR) 0 and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
