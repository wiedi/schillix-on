.SH NAME
gss_release_oid \- release an object identifier
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcc\fR [ \fIflag\fR.\|.\|. ] \fIfile\fR.\|.\|. \fB-lgss\fR  [ \fIlibrary\fR.\|.\|. ]
#include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

\fBgss_release_oid\fR(\fBOM_uint32 *\fIminor_status\fR, \fBconst gss_OID *\fIoid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgss_release_oid()\fR function deletes an \fBOID\fR. Such an
\fBOID\fR might have been created with \fBgss_str_to_oid()\fR.
.sp
.LP
Since creating and deleting individual \fBOID\fRs is discouraged, it is
preferable to use \fBgss_release_oid_set()\fR if it is necessary to
deallocate a set of \fBOID\fRs.
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.LP
The parameter descriptions for \fBgss_release_oid()\fR are as follows:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIminor_status\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
A mechanism-specific status code.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIoid\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The object identifier of the mechanism to be deleted.
.RE

.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
\fBgss_release_oid()\fR returns one of the following status codes:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_COMPLETE\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Successful completion.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_FAILURE\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific \fBGSS\fR
status code is defined.  The mechanism-specific status code reported by
means of the \fIminor_status\fR parameter details the error condition.

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
This function is included for compatibility only with programs using
earlier versions of the \fBGSS-API\fR and should not be used for new
programs. Other implementations of the \fBGSS-API\fR might not support this
function, so portable programs should not rely on it. Sun might not continue
to support this function.
