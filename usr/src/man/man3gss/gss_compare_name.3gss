.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgss_compare_name()\fR function allows an application to compare two
internal-form names to determine whether they refer to the same entity.
.sp
.LP
If either name presented to \fBgss_compare_name()\fR denotes an anonymous
principal, the routines indicate that the two names do not refer to the same
identity.
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.LP
The parameter descriptions for \fBgss_compare_name()\fR follow:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIminor_status\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Mechanism-specific status code.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIname1\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Internal-form name.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIname2\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
Internal-form name.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIname_equal\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
If non-zero, the names refer to same entity. If 0, the names refer to
different entities. Strictly, the names are not known to refer to the same
identity.
.RE

.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBgss_compare_name()\fR function may return the following status
codes:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_COMPLETE\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
Successful completion.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
The two names were of incomparable types.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_BAD_NAME\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
One or both of \fIname1\fR or \fIname2\fR was ill-formed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_FAILURE\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt
The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific \fBGSS\fR
status code is defined.  The mechanism-specific status code reported by
means of the \fIminor_status\fR parameter details the error condition.
