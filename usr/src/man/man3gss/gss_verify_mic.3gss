.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgss_verify_mic()\fR function verifies that a cryptographic
\fBMIC\fR, contained in the token parameter, fits the supplied message. The
\fIqop_state\fR parameter allows a message recipient to determine the
strength of protection that was applied to the message.
.sp
.LP
Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted by
\fBgss_wrap\fR(3GSS) to provide secure framing, the \fBGSS-API\fR supports
the calculation and verification of \fBMIC\fRs over zero-length messages.
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.LP

The status code returned by the underlying mechanism.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIcontext_handle\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Identifies the context on which the message arrived.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fImessage_buffer\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
The message to be verified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.RS 18n
.rt
The token associated with the message.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIqop_state\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt
Specifies the quality of protection gained from the \fBMIC\fR. Specify
\fBNULL\fR if this parameter is not required.
.RE

.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
\fBgss_verify_mic()\fR may return the following status codes:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_COMPLETE\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
Successful completion.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The token failed consistency checks.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_BAD_SIG\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The \fBMIC\fR was incorrect.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The token was valid and contained a correct \fBMIC\fR for the message, but
it had already been processed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_OLD_TOKEN\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The token was valid and contained a correct \fBMIC\fR for the message, but
it is too old to check for duplication.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_UNSEQ_TOKEN\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The token was valid and contained a correct \fBMIC\fR for the message, but
it has been verified out of sequence; a later token has already been
received.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_GAP_TOKEN\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The token was valid and contained a correct \fBMIC\fR for the message, but
it has been verified out of sequence; an earlier expected token has not yet
been received.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The context has already expired.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_NO_CONTEXT\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The \fIcontext_handle\fR parameter did not identify a valid context.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_FAILURE\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific \fBGSS\fR
status code is defined.  The mechanism-specific status code reported by
means of the \fIminor_status\fR parameter details the error condition.
