.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgss_unwrap()\fR function converts a message previously protected by
\fBgss_wrap\fR(3GSS) back to a usable form, verifying the embedded
\fBMIC\fR. The \fIconf_state\fR parameter indicates whether the message was
encrypted; the \fIqop_state\fR parameter indicates the strength of
protection that was used to provide the confidentiality and integrity
services.
.sp
.LP
Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted by
\fBgss_wrap\fR(3GSS) to provide secure framing, the \fBGSS-API\fR supports
the wrapping and unwrapping of zero-length messages.
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.LP
The parameter descriptions for \fBgss_unwrap()\fR follow:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIminor_status\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The status code returned by the underlying mechanism.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIcontext_handle\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
Identifies the context on which the message arrived.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIinput_message_buffer\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The message to be protected.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIoutput_message_buffer\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The buffer to receive the unwrapped message. Storage associated with this
buffer must be freed by the application after use with a call to
\fBgss_release_buffer\fR(3GSS).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIconf_state\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
If the value of \fIconf_state\fR is non-zero, then confidentiality and
integrity protection were used. If the value is zero, only integrity service
was used. Specify \fBNULL\fR if this parameter is not required.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fIqop_state\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
Specifies the quality of protection provided. Specify \fBNULL\fR if this
parameter is not required.
.RE

.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
\fBgss_unwrap()\fR may return the following status codes:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_COMPLETE\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
Successful completion.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The token failed consistency checks.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_BAD_SIG\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The \fBMIC\fR was incorrect.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The token was valid, and contained a correct \fBMIC\fR for the message, but
it had already been processed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_OLD_TOKEN\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The token was valid, and contained a correct \fBMIC\fR for the message, but
it is too old to check for duplication.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_UNSEQ_TOKEN\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The token was valid, and contained a correct \fBMIC\fR for the message, but
has been verified out of sequence; a later token has already been
received.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_GAP_TOKEN\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The token was valid, and contained a correct \fBMIC\fR for the message, but
has been verified out of sequence; an earlier expected token has not yet
been received.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The context has already expired.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_NO_CONTEXT\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The \fIcontext_handle\fR parameter did not identify a valid context.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBGSS_S_FAILURE\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific \fBGSS\fR
status code is defined.  The mechanism-specific status code reported by
means of the \fIminor_status\fR parameter details the error condition.
