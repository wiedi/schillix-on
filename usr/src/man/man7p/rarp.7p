.SH NAME
rarp, RARP \- Reverse address resolution protocol
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
You use the RARP protocol to map dynamically between the Internet Protocol
(IP) and network interface MAC addresses. RARP is often used to boot a
Solaris client. RARP clients include the SPARC boot PROM, x86 boot floppy,
SunOS kernel, and \fBifconfig\fR(1M).
.BR in.rarpd (1M)
provides the
server-side implementation.
.sp
.LP
RARP request timeout behavior in application-layer clients is governed by
the
.B /etc/inet/rarp
default file. To tune the number of retries an
application attempts before giving up, set the
.B RARP_RETRIES
variable
in
.BR /etc/inet/rarp .
If the file is not present or
.B RARP_RETRIES
is
not initialized within it, applications retry a maximum of five times with a
eight second wait between retries.
