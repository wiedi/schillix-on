.SH NAME
queue \- STREAMS queue structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/stream.h>
.fi

.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
A
.B STREAMS
driver or module consists of two
.B queue
structures:
\fIread\fR for upstream processing and \fIwrite\fR for downstream
processing. The queue structure is the major building block of a stream.
.SS "\fBqueue\fR Structure Members"
.sp
.LP
The
.B queue
structure is defined as type
.BR queue_t .
The structure
can be accessed at any time from inside a
.B STREAMS
entry point
associated with that queue.

.SS "\fBqueue_t\fR Fields"
.sp
.LP
Aside from
.B q_ptr
and
.BR q_qinfo ,
a module or driver must never
assume that a
.B queue_t
field value will remain unchanged across calls
to
.B STREAMS
entry points. In addition, many fields can change values
inside a
.B STREAMS
entry point, especially if the
.B STREAMS
module
or driver has perimeters that allow parallelism. See \fBmt-streams\fR(9F).
Fields that are not documented below are private to the
.BR STREAMS
framework and must not be accessed.
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The values of the
.BR q_hiwat ,
.BR q_lowat ,
.BR q_minpsz ,
and
\fBq_maxpsz\fR fields can be changed at the discretion of the module or
driver. As such, the stability of their values depends on the perimeter
configuration associated with any routines that modify them.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The values of the \fBq_first\fR,
.BR q_last ,
and
.B q_count
fields can
change whenever \fBputq\fR(9F), \fBputbq\fR(9F), \fBgetq\fR(9F),
.BR insq (9F),
or
.BR rmvq "(9F) is used on the queue. As such, the"
stability of their values depends on the perimeter configuration associated
with any routines that call those
.B STREAMS
functions.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The \fBq_flag\fR field can change at any time.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The
.B q_next
field will not change while inside a given
.BR STREAMS
entry point. Additional restrictions on the use of the
.B q_next
value
are described in the next section.
.RE
.sp
.LP
A
.B STREAMS
module or driver can assign any value to
.BR q_ptr .
Typically
.B q_ptr
is used to point to module-specific per-queue state,
allocated in \fBopen\fR(9E) and freed in
.BR close (9E).
The value or
contents of
.B q_ptr
is never inspected by the
.B STREAMS
framework.
.sp
.LP
The initial values for
.BR q_minpsz ,
.BR q_maxpsz ,
.BR q_hiwat ,
and
\fBq_lowat\fR are set using the \fBmodule_info\fR(9S) structure when
\fBmod_install\fR(9F) is called. A \fBSTREAMS\fR\ module or driver can
subsequently change the values of those fields as necessary. The remaining
visible fields,
.BR q_qinfo ,
\fBq_first\fR,
.BR q_last ,
.BR q_next ,
.BR q_count ,
and
.BR q_flag ,
must never be modified by a module or
driver.
.sp
.LP
The Solaris DDI requires that
.B STREAMS
modules and drivers obey the
rules described on this page. Those that do not follow the rules can cause
data corruption or system instability, and might change in behavior across
patches or upgrades.
.SS "\fBq_next\fR Restrictions"
.sp
.LP
There are additional restrictions associated with the use of the
\fBq_next\fR value. In particular, a \fBSTREAMS\fR module or driver:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Must not access the data structure pointed to by
.BR q_next .
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Must not rely on the value of
.B q_next
before calling
.BR qprocson (9F)
or after calling \fBqprocsoff\fR(9F).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Must not pass the value into any
.B STREAMS
framework function other
than \fBput\fR(9F), \fBcanput\fR(9F), \fBbcanput\fR(9F), \fBputctl\fR(9F),
\fBputctl1\fR(9F). However, in all cases the "next" version of these
functions, such as \fBputnext\fR(9F), should be preferred.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Must not use the value to compare against queue pointers from other
streams. However, checking
.B q_next
for NULL can be used to distinguish
a module from a driver in code shared by both.
