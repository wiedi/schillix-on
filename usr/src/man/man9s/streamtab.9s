.TH streamtab 9S "11 Apr 1991" "SunOS 5.11" "Data Structures for Drivers"
.SH NAME
streamtab \- STREAMS entity declaration structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/stream.h>
.fi

.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Each STREAMS driver or module must have a
.B streamtab
structure.
.sp
.LP
.B streamtab
is made up of
.B qinit
structures for both the read and
write queue portions of each module or driver. Multiplexing drivers require
both upper and lower
.B qinit
structures. The
.B qinit
structure
contains the entry points through which the module or driver routines are
called.
.sp
.LP
Normally, the read
.B QUEUE
contains the
.B open
and
.BR close
routines. Both the read and write queue can contain
.B put
and service
procedures.
