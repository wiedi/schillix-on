.TH module_info 9S "26 Nov 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Data Structures for Drivers"
.SH NAME
module_info \- STREAMS driver identification and limit value structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/stream.h>
.fi

.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
When a module or driver is declared, several identification and limit
values can be set. These values are stored in the \fBmodule_info\fR
structure.
.sp
.LP
The
.B module_info
structure is intended to be read-only. However, the
flow control limits (\fBmi_hiwat\fR and
.BR mi_lowat )
and the packet size
limits (\fBmi_minpsz\fR and
.BR mi_maxpsz )
are copied to the
.BR QUEUE
structure, where they can be modified.
.sp
.LP
For a driver,
.B mi_idname
must match the name of the driver binary
file. For a module,
.B mi_idname
must match the fname field of the
.B fmodsw
structure. See \fBfmodsw\fR(9S) for details.
