.TH vhangup 2 "19 Mar 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "System Calls"
.SH NAME
vhangup \- virtually "hangup" the current controlling terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBvhangup\fR(\fBvoid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B vhangup()
function is used by the initialization process
.BR init (1M)
(among others) to ensure that users are given "clean"
terminals at login by revoking access of the previous users' processes to
the terminal. To effect this,
.B vhangup()
searches the system tables for
references to the controlling terminal of the invoking process and revokes
access permissions on each instance of the terminal that it finds. Further
attempts to access the terminal by the affected processes will yield I/O
errors
.RB ( EBADF
or
.BR EIO ).
A
.B SIGHUP
(hangup signal) is sent to
the process group of the controlling terminal.
.SH SEE ALSO
.sp
.LP
.BR init (1M)
.SH BUGS
.sp
.LP
Access to the controlling terminal using
.B /dev/tty
is still
possible.
.sp
.LP
This call should be replaced by an automatic mechanism that takes place on
process exit.
