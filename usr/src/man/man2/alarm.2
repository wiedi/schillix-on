.SH NAME
alarm \- schedule an alarm signal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBunsigned int\fR \fBalarm\fR(\fBunsigned int\fR \fIseconds\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B alarm()
function causes the system to generate a
.BR SIGALRM
signal for the process after the number of real-time seconds specified by
seconds have  elapsed (see 
.BR signal.h (3HEAD)).
Processor scheduling
delays may prevent the process from handling the signal as soon as it is
generated.
.sp
.LP
If
.I seconds
is 0, a pending alarm request, if any, is cancelled. If
\fIseconds\fR is greater than \fBLONG_MAX\fR/\fIhz\fR, \fIseconds\fR is
rounded down to \fBLONG_MAX\fR/\fIhz\fR. The value of \fIhz\fR is normally
100.
.sp
.LP
Alarm requests are not stacked; only one
.B SIGALRM
generation can  be
scheduled in this manner; if the
.B SIGALRM
signal has not yet been
generated, the call will result in rescheduling the time at which the
\fBSIGALRM\fR signal will be generated.
.sp
.LP
The
.BR fork (2)
function clears pending alarms in the child process. A
new process image created by one of the
.BR exec (2)
functions inherits the
time left to an alarm signal in the old process's image.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If there is a previous alarm request with time  remaining, \fBalarm()\fR
returns a  non-zero  value  that  is the number of seconds until the
previous request would  have  generated  a
.B SIGALRM
signal.  Otherwise,
\fBalarm()\fR returns 0.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B alarm()
function is always successful; no return value is
reserved to indicate an error.
