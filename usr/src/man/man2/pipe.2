.SH NAME
pipe \- create an interprocess channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpipe\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR[2]);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B pipe()
function creates an I/O mechanism called a pipe and returns two
file descriptors, \fIfildes\fR[\fB0\fR] and \fIfildes\fR[\fB1\fR]. The files
associated with \fIfildes\fR[\fB0\fR] and \fIfildes\fR[\fB1\fR] are streams and
are both opened for reading and writing.  The
.BR O_NDELAY ,
.BR O_NONBLOCK ,
and
.B FD_CLOEXEC
flags are cleared on both file descriptors. The
\fBfcntl\fR(2) function can be used to set these flags.
.sp
.LP
A read from \fIfildes\fR[\fB0\fR] accesses the data written to
\fIfildes\fR[\fB1\fR] on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis and a read from
\fIfildes\fR[\fB1\fR] accesses the data written to \fIfildes\fR[\fB0\fR] also on
a
.B FIFO
basis.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion
.B pipe()
marks for update the
.BR st_atime ,
.BR st_ctime ,
and
.B st_mtime
fields of the pipe.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B 0
is returned. Otherwise,
.B \(mi1
is
returned and
.B errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B pipe()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EMFILE
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
More than {\fBOPEN_MAX\fR} file descriptors are already in use by this
process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENFILE
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The number of simultaneously open files in the system would exceed a
system-imposed limit.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Since a pipe is bi-directional, there are two separate flows of data. Therefore,
the size (\fBst_size\fR) returned by a call to
.BR fstat (2)
with argument
\fIfildes\fR[\fB0\fR] or \fIfildes\fR[\fB1\fR] is the number of bytes available
for reading from \fIfildes\fR[\fB0\fR] or \fIfildes\fR[\fB1\fR] respectively.
Previously, the size (\fBst_size\fR) returned by a call to \fBfstat()\fR with
argument \fIfildes\fR[\fB1\fR] (the write-end) was the number of bytes available
for reading from \fIfildes\fR[\fB0\fR] (the read-end).
