.TH _lwp_info 2 "8 Aug 2001" "SunOS 5.11" "System Calls"
.SH NAME
_lwp_info \- return the time-accounting information of a single LWP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/lwp.h>

\fBint\fR \fB_lwp_info\fR(\fBstruct lwpinfo *\fIbuffer\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB_lwp_info()\fR function fills the  \fBlwpinfo\fR structure pointed
to by  \fIbuffer\fR with time-accounting information pertaining to the
calling LWP. This call may be extended in the future to return other
information to the  \fBlwpinfo\fR structure as needed.  The  \fBlwpinfo\fR
structure in  <\fBsys/lwp.h\fR> includes the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
timestruc_t   lwp_utime;
timestruc_t   lwp_stime;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The
.B lwp_utime
member is the CPU time used while executing
instructions in the user space of the calling LWP.
.sp
.LP
The
.B lwp_stime
member is the CPU time used by the system on behalf of
the calling LWP.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,  \fB_lwp_info()\fR returns  \fB0\fR and fills
in the \fBlwpinfo\fR structure pointed to by  \fIbuffer\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
If the following condition is detected,  \fB_lwp_info()\fR returns the
corresponding value:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EFAULT
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The \fIbuffer\fR argument points to an illegal address.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Additionally, the \fB_lwp_info()\fR function will fail for 32-bit
interfaces if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EOVERFLOW
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
The size of the
.B tv_sec
member of the
.B timestruc_t
type pointed
to by
.B lwp_utime
and
.B lwp_stime
is too small to contain the
correct number of seconds.
