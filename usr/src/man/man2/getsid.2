.SH NAME
getsid \- get process group ID of session leader
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBpid_t\fR \fBgetsid\fR(\fBpid_t\fR \fIpid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B getsid()
function obtains the process group
.B ID
of the
process that is the session leader of the process specified by
.IR pid .
If
.I pid
is
.BR (pid_t)\|0 ,
it specifies the calling process.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B getsid()
returns the process group
.B ID
of the session leader of the specified process. Otherwise, it
returns
.B
(pid_t)\(mi1 \c
and sets
.B errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B getsid()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EPERM
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
The process specified by
.I pid
is not in the same session as the
calling process, and the implementation does not allow access to the process
group
.B ID
of the session leader of that process from the calling
process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ESRCH
.ad
.RS 9n

There is no process with a process
.B ID
equal to
.IR pid .
