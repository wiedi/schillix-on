.SH NAME
sync \- update super block
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBsync\fR(\fBvoid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B sync()
function writes all information in memory that should be
on disk, including modified super blocks, modified inodes, and delayed block
I/O.
.sp
.LP
Unlike \fBfsync\fR(3C), which completes the writing before it returns,
.B sync()
schedules but does not necessarily complete the writing before
returning.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The
.B sync()
function should be used by applications that examine a
file system, such as \fBfsck\fR(1M), and \fBdf\fR(1M), and is mandatory
before rebooting.
