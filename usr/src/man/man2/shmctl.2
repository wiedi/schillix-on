.SH NAME
shmctl \- shared memory control operations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>

\fBint\fR \fBshmctl\fR(\fBint\fR \fIshmid\fR, \fBint\fR \fIcmd\fR, \fBstruct shmid_ds *\fIbuf\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBshmctl()\fR function provides a variety of shared memory control
operations as specified by \fIcmd\fR. The permission required for a shared
memory control operation is given as {\fItoken\fR}, where \fItoken\fR is the
type of permission needed. The types of permission are interpreted as
follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
00400    READ by user
00200    WRITE by user
00040    READ by group
00020    WRITE by group
00004    READ by others
00002    WRITE by others
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
See the \fIShared Memory Operation Permissions\fR section of \fBIntro\fR(2)
for more information.
.sp
.LP
The following operations require the specified tokens:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBIPC_STAT\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
Place the current value of each member of the data structure associated
with \fIshmid\fR into the structure pointed to by \fIbuf\fR. The contents of
this structure are defined in \fBIntro\fR(2). {\fBREAD\fR}
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBIPC_SET\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
Set the value of the following members of the data structure associated
with \fIshmid\fR to the corresponding value found in the structure pointed
to by \fIbuf\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
shm_perm.uid
shm_perm.gid
shm_perm.mode	/* access permission bits only */
.fi
.in -2

This command can be executed only by a process that has appropriate
privileges or an effective user \fBID\fR equal to the value of
\fBshm_perm.cuid\fR or  \fBshm_perm.uid\fR in the data structure associated
with \fIshmid\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBIPC_RMID\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
Remove the shared memory identifier specified by \fIshmid\fR from the
system. The segment referenced by the identifier will be destroyed when all
processes with the segment attached have either detached the segment or
exited. If the segment is not attached to any process when \fBIPC_RMID\fR is
invoked, it will be destroyed immediately. This command can be executed only
by a process that has appropriate privileges or an effective user ID equal
to the value of \fBshm_perm.cuid\fR or \fBshm_perm.uid\fR in the data
structure associated with \fIshmid\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBSHM_LOCK\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
Lock the shared memory segment specified by \fIshmid\fR in memory. This
command can be executed only by a process that has appropriate privileges.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBSHM_UNLOCK\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
Unlock the shared memory segment specified by \fIshmid\fR. This command can
be executed only by a process that has appropriate privileges.
.RE

.sp
.LP
A shared memory segment must be explicitly removed using \fBIPC_RMID\fR
before the system can deallocate it and the resources it uses.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is
returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBshmctl()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEACCES\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
The \fIcmd\fR argument is equal to \fBIPC_STAT\fR and \fB{READ}\fR
operation permission is denied to the calling process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEFAULT\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
The \fIbuf\fR argument points to an illegal address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEINVAL\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
The \fIshmid\fR argument is not a valid shared memory identifier; or the
\fIcmd\fR argument is not a valid command or is \fBIPC_SET\fR and
\fBshm_perm.uid\fR or \fBshm_perm.gid\fR is not valid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBENOMEM\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
The \fIcmd\fR argument is equal to \fBSHM_LOCK\fR and there is not enough
memory, or the operation would exceed a limit or resource control on locked
memory.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEOVERFLOW\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
The \fIcmd\fR argument is \fBIPC_STAT\fR and \fIuid\fR or \fIgid\fR is too
large to be stored in the structure pointed to by \fIbuf\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEPERM\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
The \fIcmd\fR argument is equal to \fBIPC_RMID\fR or \fBIPC_SET\fR, the
effective user ID of the calling process is not equal to the value of
\fBshm_perm.cuid\fR or \fBshm_perm.uid\fR in the data structure associated
with \fIshmid\fR, and {\fBPRIV_IPC_OWNER\fR} is not asserted in the
effective set of the calling process.
.sp
The \fIcmd\fR argument is equal to \fBSHM_LOCK\fR or \fBSHM_UNLOCK\fR and
{\fBPRIV_PROC_LOCK_MEMORY\fR} is not asserted in the effective set of the
calling process.
