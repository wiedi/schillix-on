.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetauid()\fR function returns the audit user \fBID\fR for the current process. This value is initially set at login time and inherited by all child processes. This value does not change when the real/effective user \fBIDs\fR change, so it can be used to identify the logged-in user even when running a setuid program. The audit user \fBID\fR governs audit decisions for a process.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsetauid()\fR function sets the audit user \fBID\fR for the current process.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBgetauid()\fR function returns the audit user \fBID\fR of the current process on success. Otherwise, it returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion the \fBsetauid()\fR function returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetauid()\fR and \fBsetauid()\fR functions will fail if:
.sp
