operations. The \fIcmd\fR argument designates the particular audit control
command. The \fIdata\fR argument is a pointer to command-specific data. The
\fIlength\fR argument is the length in bytes of the command-specific data.

The use of \fBauditon()\fR to change system audit state is permitted only
in the global zone. From any other zone \fBauditon()\fR returns \(mi1 with
\fBerrno\fR set to \fBEPERM\fR. The following \fBauditon()\fR commands are
permitted only in the global zone: \fBA_SETCOND\fR, \fBA_SETCLASS\fR,
\fBA_SETKMASK\fR, \fBA_SETQCTRL\fR, \fBA_SETSTAT\fR, \fBA_SETFSIZE\fR, and

The functionality described in this man page is available only if the
Solaris Auditing has been enabled. See \fBbsmconv\fR(1M) for more
information.
.sp
.LP
The auditon options that modify or display process-based information are
not affected by the "perzone" audit policy. Those that modify system audit
data such as the terminal ID and audit queue parameters are valid only in
the global zone unless the "perzone" policy is set. The "get" options for
system audit data reflect the local zone if "perzone" is set; otherwise they
reflects the settings of the global zone.
