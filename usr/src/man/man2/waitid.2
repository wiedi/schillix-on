.SH NAME
waitid \- wait for child process to change state
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wait.h>

\fBint\fR \fBwaitid\fR(\fBidtype_t\fR \fIidtype\fR, \fBid_t\fR \fIid\fR, \fBsiginfo_t *\fIinfop\fR, \fBint\fR \fIoptions\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B waitid()
function suspends the calling process until one of its
child processes changes state. It records the current state of a child in
the structure pointed to by
.IR infop .
It returns immediately if a child
process changed state prior to the call.
.sp
.LP
The
.I idtype
and
.I id
arguments specify which children
\fBwaitid()\fR is to wait for, as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If
.I idtype
is
.BR P_PID ,
\fBwaitid()\fR waits for the child with a
process \fBID\fR equal to \fB(pid_t)\fIid\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If
.I idtype
is
.BR P_PGID ,
\fBwaitid()\fR waits for any child with a
process group \fBID\fR equal to \fB(pid_t)\fIid\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If
.I idtype
is
.BR P_ALL ,
\fBwaitid()\fR waits for any child and
\fIid\fR is ignored.
.RE
.sp
.LP
The
.I options
argument is used to specify which state changes
\fBwaitid()\fR is to wait for. It is formed by bitwise \fBOR\fR operation of
any of the following flags:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B WCONTINUED
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
Return the status for any child that was stopped and has been continued.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B WEXITED
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
Wait for process(es) to exit.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B WNOHANG
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
Return immediately.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B WNOWAIT
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
Keep the process in a waitable state.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B WSTOPPED
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
Wait for and return the process status of any child that has  stopped upon
receipt of a signal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B WTRAPPED
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
Wait for traced process(es) to become trapped or reach a breakpoint (see
.BR ptrace (3C)).
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fIinfop\fR argument must point to a \fBsiginfo_t\fR structure, as
defined in \fBsiginfo.h\fR(3HEAD). If
.B waitid()
returns because a child
process was found that satisfies the conditions indicated by the arguments
\fIidtype\fR and
.IR options ,
then the structure pointed to by \fIinfop\fR
will be filled by the system with the status of the process. The
\fBsi_signo\fR member will always be equal to
.BR SIGCHLD .
.sp
.LP
One instance of a
.B SIGCHLD
signal is queued for each child process
whose status has changed. If
.B waitid()
returns because the status of a
child process is available and
.B WNOWAIT
was not specified in
.IR options ,
any pending
.B SIGCHLD
signal associated with the process
ID of that child process is discarded. Any other pending \fBSIGCHLD\fR
signals remain pending.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If
.B waitid()
returns due to a change of state of one of its children
and
.B WNOHANG
was not used,
.B 0
is returned.  Otherwise,
\fB\(mi1\fR is returned and  \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error. If
\fBWNOHANG\fR was used,  \fB0\fR can be returned (indicating no error);
however, no children may have changed state if \fBinfo->si_pid\fR is
.BR 0 .
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B waitid()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ECHILD
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The set of processes specified by
.I idtype
and
.I id
does not
contain any unwaited processes.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EFAULT
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The \fIinfop\fR argument points to an illegal address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINTR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The
.B waitid()
function was interrupted due to the receipt of a signal
by the calling process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINVAL
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
An invalid value was specified for
.IR options ,
or
.I idtype
and
\fIid\fR specify an invalid set of processes.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
With
.I options
equal to
.B WEXITED
|
.BR WTRAPPED ,
.B waitid()
is equivalent to \fBwaitpid\fR(3C). With \fIidtype\fR equal to \fBP_ALL\fR
and
.I options
equal to
.B WEXITED
|
.BR WTRAPPED ,
\fBwaitid()\fR is
equivalent to
.BR wait (3C).
