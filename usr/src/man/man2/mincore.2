.SH NAME
mincore \- determine residency of memory pages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>

\fBint\fR \fBmincore\fR(\fBcaddr_t\fR \fIaddr\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIlen\fR, \fBchar *\fIvec\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B mincore()
function determines the residency of the memory pages in
the address space covered by mappings in the range [\fIaddr\fR,
.I addr
+
\fIlen\fR]. The status is returned as a character-per-page in the character
array referenced by
.I *vec
(which the system assumes to be large enough
to encompass all the pages in the address range). The least significant bit
of each character is set to 1 to indicate that the referenced page is in
primary memory, and to 0 to indicate that it is not. The settings of other
bits in each character are undefined and may contain other information in
future implementations.
.sp
.LP
Because the status of a page can change between the time
.BR mincore()
checks and returns the information, returned information might be outdated.
Only locked pages are guaranteed to remain in memory; see \fBmlock\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B mincore()
returns
.BR 0 .
Otherwise,
\fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B mincore()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EFAULT
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The
.I vec
argument points to an illegal address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINVAL
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The
.I addr
argument is not a multiple of the page size as returned by
\fBsysconf\fR(3C), or the  \fIlen\fR argument has a value less than or equal
to 0.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENOMEM
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Addresses in the range [\fIaddr, addr + len\fR] are invalid for the address
space of a process or specify one or more pages which are not mapped.
