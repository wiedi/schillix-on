.TH _lwp_cond_signal 2 "8 Dec 1995" "SunOS 5.11" "System Calls"
.SH NAME
_lwp_cond_signal, _lwp_cond_broadcast \- signal a condition variable
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/lwp.h>

\fBint\fR \fB_lwp_cond_signal\fR(\fBlwp_cond_t *\fIcvp\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fB_lwp_cond_broadcast\fR(\fBlwp_cond_t *\fIcvp\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B _lwp_cond_signal()
function unblocks one LWP that is blocked on
the LWP condition variable pointed to by
.IR cvp .
.sp
.LP
The
.B _lwp_cond_broadcast()
function unblocks all LWPs that are blocked
on the LWP condition variable pointed to by
.IR cvp .
.sp
.LP
If no LWPs are blocked on the LWP condition variable, then
\fB_lwp_cond_signal()\fR and \fB_lwp_cond_broadcast()\fR have no effect.
.sp
.LP
Both functions should be called under the protection of the same LWP mutex
lock that is used with the LWP condition variable being signaled.
Otherwise, the condition variable may be signalled between the test of the
associated condition and blocking in
.BR _lwp_cond_wait() .
This can cause
an infinite wait.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B 0
is returned. A non-zero value indicates
an error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B _lwp_cond_signal()
and
.B _lwp_cond_broadcast()
functions will
fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINVAL
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The
.I cvp
argument points to an invalid LWP condition variable.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EFAULT
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The
.I cvp
argument points to an invalid address.
