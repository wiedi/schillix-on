.SH NAME
mprotect \- set protection of memory mapping
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/mman.h>

\fBint\fR \fBmprotect\fR(\fBvoid *\fIaddr\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIlen\fR, \fBint\fR \fIprot\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B mprotect()
function changes the access protections on the
mappings specified by the range [\fIaddr, addr + len\fR\|), rounding
.I len
up to the next multiple of the page size as returned by
.BR sysconf (3C),
to be that specified by
.IR prot .
Legitimate values for
.I prot
are the same as those permitted for
.BR mmap (2)
and are defined
in <\fBsys/mman.h\fR> as:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B PROT_READ
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
.B "/* page can be read */
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B PROT_WRITE
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
.B "/* page can be written */
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B PROT_EXEC
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
.B "/* page can be executed */
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B PROT_NONE
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt
.B "/* page can not be accessed */
.RE

.sp
.LP
When
.B mprotect()
fails for reasons other than
.BR EINVAL ,
the
protections on some of the pages in the range [\fIaddr, addr + len\fR) may
have been changed. If the error occurs on some page at
.IR addr2 ,
then the
protections of all whole pages in the range [\fIaddr, addr2\fR] will have
been modified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B mprotect()
returns
.BR 0 .
Otherwise, it
returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets
.B errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B mprotect()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EACCES
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The
.I prot
argument specifies a protection that violates the access
permission the process has to the underlying memory object.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINVAL
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The
.I len
argument has a value equal to 0, or
.I addr
is not a
multiple of the page size as returned by \fBsysconf\fR(3C).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENOMEM
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Addresses in the range [\fIaddr, addr + len\fR) are invalid for the address
space of a process, or specify one or more pages which are not mapped.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The
.B mprotect()
function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EAGAIN
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The address range [\fIaddr, addr + len\fR) includes one or more pages that
have been locked in memory and that were mapped
.B MAP_PRIVATE;
.I prot
includes
.B PROT_WRITE;
and the system has insufficient resources to
reserve memory for the private pages that may be created. These private
pages may be created by store operations in the now-writable address
range.
