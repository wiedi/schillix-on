.SH NAME
times \- get process and child process times
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/times.h>
#include <limits.h>

\fBclock_t\fR \fBtimes\fR(\fBstruct tms *\fIbuffer\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B times()
function fills the
.B tms
structure pointed to by
\fIbuffer\fR with time-accounting information. The \fBtms\fR structure,
defined in
.BR <sys/times.h> ,
contains the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
clock_t    tms_utime;
clock_t    tms_stime;
clock_t    tms_cutime;
clock_t    tms_cstime;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
All times are reported in clock ticks. The specific value for a clock tick
is defined by the variable
.BR CLK_TCK ,
found in the header
<\fBlimits.h\fR>.
.sp
.LP
The times of a terminated child process are included in the
\fBtms_cutime\fR and \fBtms_cstime\fR members of the parent when
.BR wait (3C)
or \fBwaitpid\fR(3C) returns the process \fBID\fR of this
terminated child.  If a child process has not waited for its children, their
times will not be included in its times.
.sp
.LP
The
.B tms_utime
member is the
.B CPU
time used while executing
instructions in the user space of the calling process.
.sp
.LP
The
.B tms_stime
member is the
.B CPU
time used by the system on
behalf of the calling process.
.sp
.LP
The
.B tms_cutime
member is the sum of the
.B tms_utime
and the
\fBtms_cutime\fR of the child processes.
.sp
.LP
The
.B tms_cstime
member is the sum of the
.B tms_stime
and the
\fBtms_cstime\fR of the child processes.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B times()
returns the elapsed real time, in
clock ticks, since an arbitrary point in the past (for example, system
start-up time). This point does not change from one invocation of
\fBtimes()\fR within the process to another. The return value may overflow
the possible range of type
.BR clock_t .
If
.B times()
fails,
\fB(clock_t)\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the
error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B times()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EFAULT
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The \fIbuffer\fR argument points to an illegal address.
