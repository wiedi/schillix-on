.TH setsid 2 "21 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "System Calls"
.SH NAME
setsid \- create session and set process group ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

\fBpid_t\fR \fBsetsid\fR(\fBvoid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B setsid()
function creates a new session, if the calling process
is not a process group leader. Upon return the calling process will be the
session leader of this new session, will be the process group leader of a
new process group, and will have no controlling terminal. The process group
.B ID
of the calling process will be set equal to the process
.B ID
of
the calling process. The calling process will be the only process in the new
process group and the only process in the new session.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B setsid()
returns the value of the process
group
.B ID
of the calling process. Otherwise it returns
\fB(pid_t)\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B setsid()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EPERM
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
The calling process is already a process group leader, or the process group
.B ID
of a process other than the calling process matches the process
.B ID
of the calling process.

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
A call to
.B setsid()
by a process that is a process group leader will
fail. A process can become a process group leader by being the last member
of a pipeline started by a job control shell. Thus, a process that expects
to be part of a pipeline, and that calls
.BR setsid() ,
should always first
fork; the parent should exit and the child should call
.BR setsid() .
This
will ensure that the calling process will work reliably when started by both
job control shells and non-job control shells.
