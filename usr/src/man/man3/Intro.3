Intro, intro \- introduction to functions and libraries
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This section describes functions found in various Solaris libraries, other
than those functions described in Section 2 of this manual that directly
invoke UNIX system primitives. Function declarations can be obtained from
the
.B #include
files indicated on each page. Pages are grouped by
library and are identified by the library name (or an abbreviation of the
library name) after the section number. Collections of related libraries are
grouped into volumes as described below. The first volume contains pages
describing the contents of each shared library and each header used by the
functions, macros, and external variables described in the remaining
volumes.
.SS "Library Interfaces and Headers"
.sp
.LP
This volume describes the contents of each shared library and each header
used by functions, macros, and external variables described in the remaining
volumes.

.B (3LIB)

.sp .6
.RS 4n
The libraries described in this section are implemented as shared
objects.
.sp
Descriptions of shared objects can include a definition of the global
symbols that define the shared objects' public interface, for example
.BR SUNW_1.1 .
Other interfaces can exist within the shared object, for
example
.BR SUNWprivate.1.1 .
The public interface provides a stable,
committed set of symbols for application development. The private interfaces
are for internal use only, and could change at any time.

.RS 4n
The headers described in this section are used by functions, macros, and
external variables. Headers contain function prototypes, definitions of
symbolic constants, common structures, preprocessor macros, and defined
types. Each function described in the remaining five volumes specifies the
headers that an application must include in order to use that function. In
most cases only one header is required. These headers are present on an
application development system; they do have to be present on the target
execution system.

that are basic to application development.

.B (3C)

.RS 4n
These functions, together with those of Section 2, constitute the standard
C library,
.BR libc ,
which is automatically linked by the C compilation
system. The standard C library is implemented as a shared object,
\fBlibc.so\fR. See \fBlibc\fR(3LIB) and the "C Compilation System" chapter
of the
.I "ANSI C Programmer's Guide"
for a discussion. Some functions
behave differently in standard-conforming environments. This behavior is
noted on the individual manual pages. See
.BR standards (5).
.sp
The
.B libpthread
and
.B libthread
libraries are filter libraries on
.B libc
that are used for building multithreaded applications:
.B libpthread
implements the POSIX (see
.BR standards (5))
threads
interface, whereas
.B libthread
implements the Solaris threads interface.

.BR "MULTITHREADED APPLICATIONS" ,
below.

Under all circumstances, the use of the Sockets API is recommended over the
XTI and TLI APIs. If portability to other XPGV4v2 (see
.BR standards (5))
.RB "systems is a requirement, the application must use the" " libxnet"
interfaces. If portability is not required, the sockets interfaces in
.B libsocket
and
.B libnsl
are recommended over those in
.BR libxnet .

.SH DEFINITIONS
.sp
.LP
A character is any bit pattern able to fit into a byte on the machine. In
some international languages, however, a "character" might require more than
one byte, and is represented in multi-bytes.
.sp
.LP
The null character is a character with value 0, conventionally represented
in the C language as \fB\e\|0\fR\&. A character array is a sequence of
characters. A null-terminated character array
.RI "(a " string )
is a sequence
of characters, the last of which is the null character. The null string is a
character array containing only the terminating null character. A null
pointer is the value that is obtained by casting
.B 0
into a pointer. C
guarantees that this value will not match that of any legitimate pointer, so
many functions that return pointers return
.I NULL
to indicate an error.
The macro
.I NULL
is defined in
.RB < stdio.h >.
Types of the form
.B size_t
are defined in the appropriate headers.
.SH MULTITHREADED APPLICATIONS
.sp
.LP
Both POSIX threads and Solaris threads can be used within the same
application. Their implementations are completely compatible with each
other; however, only POSIX threads guarantee portability to other
POSIX-conforming environments.

When compiling a multithreaded application, the
.B -mt
option must be
specified on the command line.
.sp
.LP
There is no need for a multithreaded application to link with
.BR -lthread .
An application must link with
.B -lpthread
only when
POSIX semantics for
.BR fork (2)
are desired. When an application is linked
with
.BR -lpthread ,
a call to
.B fork()
assumes the behavior
.BR fork1 (2)
rather than the default behavior that forks all threads.
.sp
.LP
When compiling a POSIX-conforming application, either the
.B _POSIX_C_SOURCE
or
.B _POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS

the
.B _POSIX_C_SOURCE

.LP
For functions that return floating-point values, error handling varies
according to compilation mode. Under the
.B -Xt
(default) option to
.BR cc ,
these functions return the conventional values
.BR 0 ,
\fB\(+-HUGE\fR, or
.B NaN
when the function is undefined for the given
arguments or when the value is not representable. In the
.B -Xa
and
.B -Xc
compilation modes, \fB\(+-HUGE_VAL\fR is returned instead of
\fB\(+-HUGE\fR\&. (\fBHUGE_VAL\fR and
.B HUGE
are defined in \fBmath.h\fR
to be infinity and the largest-magnitude single-precision number,
respectively.)
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
None of the functions, external variables, or macros should be redefined in
the user's programs. Any other name can be redefined without affecting the
behavior of other library functions, but such redefinition might conflict
with a declaration in an included header.
.sp
.LP
The headers in
.I INCDIR
provide function prototypes (function
declarations including the types of arguments) for most of the functions
listed in this manual. Function prototypes allow the compiler to check for
correct usage of these functions in the user's program. The
.B lint
program checker can also be used and will report discrepancies even if the
headers are not included with
.B #include
statements. Definitions for
Sections 2 and 3C are checked automatically. Other definitions can be
included by using the
.B -l
option to
.BR lint .
.RB "(For example," " -lm"
includes definitions for
.BR libm .)
Use of
.B lint
is highly
recommended. See the
.B lint
chapter in \fIPerformance Profiling Tools\fR

.LP
Users should carefully note the difference between STREAMS and
.IR stream .
STREAMS is a set of kernel mechanisms that support the
development of network services and data communication drivers. It is
composed of utility routines, kernel facilities, and a set of data
structures. A
.I stream
is a file with its associated buffering. It is
declared to be a pointer to a type
.B FILE
defined in
.BR <stdio.h> .
.sp
.LP
In detailed definitions of components, it is sometimes necessary to refer
to symbolic names that are implementation-specific, but which are not
necessarily expected to be accessible to an application program. Many of
these symbolic names describe boundary conditions and system limits.
.sp
.LP
In this section, for readability, these implementation-specific values are
given symbolic names. These names always appear enclosed in curly brackets
to distinguish them from symbolic names of other implementation-specific
constants that are accessible to application programs by headers. These
names are not necessarily accessible to an application program through a
header, although they can be defined in the documentation for a particular
system.
.sp
.LP
In general, a portable application program should not refer to these
symbolic names in its code. For example, an application program would not be
expected to test the length of an argument list given to a routine to
determine if it was greater than
.RB { ARG_MAX }.
