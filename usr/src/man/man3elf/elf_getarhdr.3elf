.SH NAME
elf_getarhdr \- retrieve archive member header
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc [ \fIflag\fR .\|.\|. ] \fIfile\fR .\|.\|. \fB-lelf\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR.\|.\|. ]
#include <libelf.h>

\fBElf_Arhdr *\fBelf_getarhdr\fR(\fBElf *\fIelf\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBelf_getarhdr()\fR returns a pointer to an archive member header, if one
is available for the
.B ELF
descriptor
.IR elf .
Otherwise, no archive
member header exists, an error occurred, or \fIelf\fR was null;
\fBelf_getarhdr()\fR then returns a null value. The header includes the
following members.

.LP
An archive member name, available through
.BR ar_name ,
is a
null-terminated string, with the
.B ar
format control characters removed.
The
.B ar_rawname
member holds a null-terminated string that represents
the original name bytes in the file, including the terminating slash and
trailing blanks as specified in the archive format.
.sp
.LP
In addition to ``regular'' archive members, the archive format defines some
special members. All special member names begin with a slash
.RB ( / ),
distinguishing them from regular members (whose names may not contain a
slash). These special members have the names (\fBar_name\fR) defined
below.

This is the archive symbol table. If present, it will be the first archive
member. A program may access the archive symbol table through
\fBelf_getarsym()\fR. The information in the symbol table is useful for
random archive processing (see \fBelf_rand()\fR on \fBelf_begin\fR(3ELF)).

.rt
This member, if present, holds a string table for long archive member
names. An archive member's header contains a 16-byte area for the name,
which may be exceeded in some file systems. The library automatically
retrieves long member names from the string table, setting
.B ar_name
to
the appropriate value.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Under some error conditions, a member's name might not be available.
Although this causes the library to set
.B ar_name
to a null pointer, the
\fBar_rawname\fR member will be set as usual.
