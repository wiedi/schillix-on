.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
For these functions, \fIsession\fR specifies which session to use to
communicate with the MMS.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmms_send_cmd()\fR function sends an MMP command \fIcmd\fR with a
task ID of \fItid\fR to MMS. On successful completion of the command, the
response is returned in rsp. This function can be used in either a
synchronous or asynchronous session.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmms_send_acmd()\fR function sends an MMP command \fIcmd\fR with a
task ID of \fItid\fR to MMS, but does not wait for a response from MMS. When
a response is received, the API invokes the call back function \fIcallbk\fR,
passing \fIcallbk_parm\fR as the first argument and the response as the
second argument. This function can only be used in an asynchronous
session.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmms_read_response()\fR function obtains additional responses if the
response to \fBmms_send_cmd()\fR or \fBmms_send_acmd()\fR function returned
an "intermediate" response. This occurs when the response exceeds the
allowed size and has to be delivered in several separate responses.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmms_free_rsp()\fR function frees the memory associated with a
response from one of the communication functions.
.SS "Response Types"
.sp
.LP
There are five possible responses from MMS:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBcancelled\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The client cancelled the command prior to MMS starting execution of it.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBerror\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The command failed to be executed. The format of the error response
contains a error class and code indicating the type of failure that
occurred. An optional error message may also be specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBintermediate\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The response contains data that exceeds a preset memory size that a
response can contain. If a command generates a response that exceeds the
preset memory size, MMS breaks the response into a series of responses
consisting of one or more intermediate responses followed by a success
response. Each of the intermediate responses and the success response will
contain a valid response structure that the client can process
individually.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBsuccess\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The command has completed successfully. The data that is returned with the
success response is dependent on what the command requested for a report.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBunacceptable\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The syntax of the command the client sent to MMS was invalid.
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBMMS_API_OK\fR is returned. If a function
encounters a processing error, it returns an error code indicating the type
of error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
These functions will fail if:
