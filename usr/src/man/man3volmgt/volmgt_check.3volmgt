.SH NAME
volmgt_check \- have Volume Management check for media
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcc\fR [ \fIflag\fR.\|.\|. ] \fIfile\fR.\|.\|. \fB-lvolmgt\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR .\|.\|. ]
#include <volmgt.h>

\fBint\fR \fBvolmgt_check\fR(\fBchar *\fIpathname\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This function is obsolete. The management of removable media by the Volume
Management feature, including
.BR vold ,
has been replaced by software that
supports the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Programmatic support for HAL
is through the HAL APIs, which are documented on the HAL web site. See
.BR hal (5).
The return value of this function is undefined.
.sp
.LP
This routine asks volume Management to check the specified
.IR pathname
and determine if new media has been inserted in that drive.
.sp
.LP
If a null pointer is passed in, then Volume Management will check each
device it is managing that can be checked.
.sp
.LP
If new media is found,
.B volmgt_check()
tells volume management to
initiate appropriate actions.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The return from this function is undefined.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
This routine can fail, returning
.BR 0 ,
if a
.BR stat (2)
or
.BR open (2)
of the supplied
.I pathname
fails, or if any of the
following is true:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENXIO
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
volume management is not running.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINTR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
An interrupt signal was detected while checking for media.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
.B Example 1
Checking If Any New Media Is Inserted
.sp
.LP
To check if any drive managed by volume management has any new media
inserted in it:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
if (volmgt_check(NULL)) {
        (void) printf("Volume management found media\en");
}
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
This would also request volume management to take whatever action was
appropriate for the new media.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Since
.B volmgt_check()
returns
.B 0
for two different cases (both
when no media is found, and when an error occurs), it is up to the user to
check
.I errno
to differentiate the two, and to ensure that volume
management is running.
