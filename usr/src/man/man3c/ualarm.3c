.TH ualarm 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
ualarm \- schedule signal after interval in microseconds
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBuseconds_t\fR \fBualarm\fR(\fBuseconds_t\fR \fIuseconds\fR, \fBuseconds_t\fR \fIinterval\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B ualarm()
function causes the
.B SIGALRM
signal to be generated
for the calling process after the number of real-time microseconds specified
by the
.I useconds
.RI "argument has elapsed.  When the" " interval"
argument is non-zero, repeated timeout notification occurs with a period in
microseconds specified by the
.I interval
argument. If the notification
signal,
.BR SIGALRM ,
is not caught or ignored, the calling process is
terminated.
.sp
.LP
Because of scheduling delays, resumption of execution when the signal is
caught may be delayed an arbitrary amount of time.
.sp
.LP
Interactions between
.B ualarm()
and either
.BR alarm (2)
or
.BR sleep (3C)
are unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The
.B ualarm()
function returns the number of microseconds remaining
from the previous
.B ualarm()
call.  If no timeouts are pending or if
.B ualarm()
has not previously been called,
.B ualarm()
returns
.BR 0 .
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The
.B ualarm()
function is a simplified interface to
.BR setitimer (2),
and uses the
.B ITIMER_REAL
interval timer.
