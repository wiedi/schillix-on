.SH NAME
posix_memalign \- aligned memory allocation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/mman.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_memalign\fR(\fBvoid **\fImemptr\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIalignment\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIsize\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B posix_memalign()
function allocates size bytes aligned on a
boundary specified by alignment, and returns a pointer to the allocated
memory in
.IR memptr .
The value of alignment must be a power of two
multiple of \fBsizeof\fR(\fBvoid *\fR).
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the value pointed to by
.I memptr
will be a
multiple of alignment.
.sp
.LP
If the size of the space requested is 0, the value returned in \fImemptr\fR
will be a null pointer.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfree\fR(3C) function will deallocate memory that has previously been
allocated by
.BR posix_memalign() .
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B posix_memalign()
returns zero. Otherwise,
an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B posix_memalign()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINVAL
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The value of the alignment parameter is not a power of two multiple of
\fBsizeof\fR(\fBvoid *\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENOMEM
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
There is insufficient memory available with the requested alignment.
