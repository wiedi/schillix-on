.nf
#include <stdlib.h>

\fBchar *\fBgetpass\fR(\fBconst char *\fIprompt\fR);
.fi

.LP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B getpass()
function opens the process's controlling terminal,
writes to that device the null-terminated string
.IR prompt ,
disables
echoing, reads a string of characters up to the next newline character or
EOF, restores the terminal state and closes the terminal.
.sp
.LP
The
.B getpassphrase()
function is identical to
.BR getpass() ,
except
that it reads and returns a string of up to 257 characters in length.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B getpass()
returns a pointer to a
null-terminated string of at most 9 bytes that were read from the terminal
device. If an error is encountered, the terminal state is restored and a
null pointer is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B getpass()
and
.B getpassphrase()
functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINTR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The function was interrupted by a signal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EIO
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The process is a member of a background process attempting to read from its
.RB "controlling terminal, the process is ignoring or blocking the" " SIGTTIN"
signal or the process group is orphaned.
