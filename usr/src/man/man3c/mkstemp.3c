.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B mkstemp()
function replaces the contents of the string pointed to
by
.I template
by a unique file name, and returns a file descriptor for
the file open for reading and writing. The function thus prevents any
possible race condition between testing whether the file exists and opening
it for use. The string in
.I template
should look like a file name with
six trailing 'X's;
.B mkstemp()
replaces each 'X' with a character from
the portable file name character set. The characters are chosen such that
the resulting name does not duplicate the name of an existing file.
.sp
.LP
The
.B mkstemps()
function behaves the same as
.BR mkstemp() ,
except
it permits a suffix to exist in the template. The template should be of the
form /\fBtmp\fR/\fBtmp\fIXXXXXX\fIsuffix\fR. The \fIslen\fR parameter
specifies the length of the suffix string.
.sp
.LP
The
.B mkdtemp()
function makes the same replacement to the template as
in
.BR mktemp "(3C) and creates the template directory using"
.BR mkdir (2),
passing a
.I mode
argument of 0700.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B mkstemp()
returns an open file
descriptor. Otherwise \(mi1 is returned if no suitable file could be
created.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.BR mkstemp() ,
.BR mkstemps() ,
and
.B mkdtemp()
functions can
set
.B errno
to the same values as
.BR lstat (2).
.sp
.LP
The
.B mkstemp()
and
.B mkstemps()
functions can set
.B errno
to
the same values as
.BR open (2).
.sp
.LP
The
.B mkdtemp()
function can set
.B errno
to the same values as
.BR mkdir (2).
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
It is possible to run out of letters.
.sp
.LP
The
.B mkstemp()
function does not check to determine whether the file
name part of
.I template
exceeds the maximum allowable file name
length.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtmpfile\fR(3C) function is preferred over this function.
.sp
.LP
The
.B mkstemp()
function is frequently used to create a temporary file
that will be removed by the application before the application terminates.
.sp
.LP
The
.B mkstemp()
function has a transitional interface for 64-bit file
offsets. See
.BR lf64 (5).
