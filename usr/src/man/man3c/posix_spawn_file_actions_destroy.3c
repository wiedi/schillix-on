.SH NAME
posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy, posix_spawn_file_actions_init \- destroy
and initialize spawn file actions object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <spawn.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_destroy\fR(
     \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_t *\fIfile_actions\fR);
.fi

.nf
\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_init\fR(
     \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_t *\fIfile_actions\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_destroy()\fR function destroys the object
referenced by
.IR file_actions .
The object becomes, in effect,
uninitialized. An implementation can cause
\fBposix_spawn_file_actions_destroy()\fR to set the object referenced by
file_actions to an invalid value. A destroyed spawn file actions object can
be reinitialized using
.BR posix_spawn_file_actions_init() .
The results of
otherwise referencing the object after it has been destroyed are
undefined.
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_init()\fR function initializes the object
referenced by \fIfile_actions\fR to contain no file actions for
.BR posix_spawn (3C)
or \fBposix_spawnp\fR(3C) to perform.
.sp
.LP
A spawn file actions object is as defined in
.BR posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose (3C).
.sp
.LP
The effect of initializing an already initialized spawn file actions object
is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return 0. Otherwise, an error
number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_init()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENOMEM
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Insufficient memory exists to initialize the spawn file actions object.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_destroy()\fR function will may if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINVAL
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The value specified by \fIfile_actions\fR is invalid.
