.TH tcsendbreak 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
tcsendbreak \- send a ``break'' for a specific duration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>

\fBint\fR \fBtcsendbreak\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR, \fBint\fR \fIduration\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fIfildes\fR argument is an open file descriptor associated with a
terminal.
.sp
.LP
If the terminal is using asynchronous serial data transmission,
\fBtcsendbreak()\fR will cause transmission of a continuous stream of
zero-valued bits for a specific duration.  If
.I duration
is 0, it will
cause transmission of zero-valued bits for at least 0.25 seconds, and not
more than 0.5 seconds.  If
.I duration
is not 0, it behaves in a way
similar to
.BR tcdrain (3C).
.sp
.LP
If the terminal is not using asynchronous serial data transmission, it
sends data to generate a break condition or returns without taking any
action.
.sp
.LP
Attempts to use
.B tcsendbreak()
from a process which is a member of a
background process group on a \fIfildes\fR associated with its controlling
terminal will cause the process group to be sent a
.B SIGTTOU
signal. If
the calling process is blocking or ignoring
.B SIGTTOU
signals, the
process is allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B 0
is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is
returned and
.B errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B tcsendbreak()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EBADF
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The \fIfildes\fR argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENOTTY
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The file associated with \fIfildes\fR is not a terminal.

.LP
The
.B tcsendbreak()
function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EIO
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt
The process group of the writing process is orphaned, and the writing
process is not ignoring or blocking
.BR SIGTTOU .
