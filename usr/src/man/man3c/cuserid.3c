.TH cuserid 3C "30 Dec 1996" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
cuserid \- get character login name of the user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>

\fBchar *\fBcuserid\fR(\fBchar *\fIs\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcuserid()\fR function generates a character-string representation of
the login name under which the owner of the current process is logged in. If
\fIs\fR is a null pointer, this representation is generated in an internal
static area whose address is returned. Otherwise, \fIs\fR is assumed to
point to an array of at least \fBL_cuserid\fR characters; the representation
is left in this array. The constant \fBL_cuserid\fR is defined in the
<\fBstdio.h\fR> header.
.sp
.LP
In multithreaded applications, the caller must always supply an array
\fIs\fR for the return value.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If the login name cannot be found, \fBcuserid()\fR returns a null pointer.
If \fIs\fR is not a null pointer, the null character \fB`\e0'\fR will be
placed at \fIs\fR[\fB0\fR].
