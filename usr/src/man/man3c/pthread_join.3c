.SH NAME
pthread_join \- wait for thread termination
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR.\|.\|. ] \fIfile\fR.\|.\|. -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR.\|.\|. ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_join\fR(\fBpthread_t\fR \fIthread\fR, \fBvoid **\fIstatus\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_join()
function suspends processing of the calling thread
until the target
.I thread
completes.
.I thread
must be a member of the
current process and it cannot be a detached thread. See
.BR pthread_create (3C).
.sp
.LP
If two or more threads wait for the same thread to complete, all will suspend
processing until the thread has terminated, and then one thread will return
successfully and the others will return with an error of
.BR ESRCH .
The
\fBpthread_join()\fR function will not block processing of the calling thread
if the target
.I thread
has already terminated.
.sp
.LP
If a
.B pthread_join()
call returns successfully with a non-null
\fIstatus\fR argument, the value passed to \fBpthread_exit\fR(3C) by the
terminating thread will be placed in the location referenced by
.IR status .

.sp
.LP
If the
.B pthread_join()
calling thread is cancelled, then the target
\fIthread\fR will remain joinable by
.BR pthread_join() .
However, the
calling thread may set up a cancellation cleanup handler on
.I thread
prior
to the join call, which may detach the target
.I thread
by calling
.BR pthread_detach (3C).
See
.BR pthread_detach "(3C) and"
.BR pthread_cancel (3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful,
.B pthread_join()
returns
.BR 0 .
Otherwise, an error
number is returned to indicate the error.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The pthread_join(3C) function must specify the
.I thread
\fBID\fR for
whose termination it will wait.
.sp
.LP
Calling \fBpthread_join()\fR also "detaches" the thread; that is,
\fBpthread_join()\fR includes the effect of the \fBpthread_detach()\fR
function. If a thread were to be cancelled when blocked in
.BR pthread_join() ,
an explicit detach would have to be performed in the
cancellation cleanup handler. The
.B pthread_detach()
function exists
primarily for this purpose.
