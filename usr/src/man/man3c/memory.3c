.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions operate as efficiently as possible on memory areas (arrays
of bytes bounded by a count, not terminated by a null character). They do
not check for the overflow of any receiving memory area.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmemccpy()\fR function copies bytes from memory area \fIs2\fR into
\fIs1\fR, stopping after the first occurrence of \fIc\fR (converted to an
\fBunsigned char\fR) has been copied, or after \fIn\fR bytes have been
copied, whichever comes first. It returns a pointer to the byte after the
copy of \fIc\fR in \fIs1\fR, or a null pointer if \fIc\fR was not found in
the first \fIn\fR bytes of \fIs2\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmemchr()\fR function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of
\fIc\fR (converted to an \fBunsigned char\fR) in the first \fIn\fR bytes
(each interpreted as an \fBunsigned char\fR) of memory area \fIs\fR, or a
null pointer if \fIc\fR does not occur.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmemcmp()\fR function compares its arguments, looking at the first
\fIn\fR bytes (each interpreted as an \fBunsigned char\fR), and returns an
integer less than, equal to, or greater than 0, according as \fIs1\fR is
lexicographically less than, equal to, or greater than \fIs2\fR when taken
to be unsigned characters.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmemcpy()\fR function copies \fIn\fR bytes from memory area \fIs2\fR
to \fIs1\fR. It returns \fIs1\fR. If copying takes place between objects
that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmemmove()\fR function copies \fIn\fR bytes from memory area \fIs2\fR
to memory area \fIs1\fR. Copying between objects that overlap will take
place correctly. It returns \fIs1\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmemset()\fR function sets the first \fIn\fR bytes in memory area
\fIs\fR to the value of \fIc\fR (converted to an \fBunsigned char\fR). It
returns \fIs\fR.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
Using \fBmemcpy()\fR might be faster than using \fBmemmove()\fR if the
application knows that the objects being copied do not overlap.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Overlap between objects being copied can arise even when their (virtual)
address ranges appear to be disjoint; for example, as a result of
memory-mapping overlapping portions of the same underlying file, or of
attaching the same shared memory segment more than once.
