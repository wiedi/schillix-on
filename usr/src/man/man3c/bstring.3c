.SH NAME
bstring, bcopy, bcmp, bzero \- memory operations
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <strings.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBbcopy\fR(\fBconst void *\fR\fIs1\fR, \fBvoid *\fR\fIs2\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);

\fBint\fR \fBbcmp\fR(\fBconst void *\fR\fIs1\fR, \fBconst void *\fR\fIs2\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);

\fBvoid\fR \fBbzero\fR(\fBvoid *\fR\fIs\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The  \fBbcopy()\fR, \fBbcmp()\fR, and \fBbzero()\fR functions operate as
efficiently as possible on memory areas (arrays of bytes bounded by a count,
not terminated by a null character).  They do not check for  the  overflow
of any receiving memory area.  These functions are similar to the
\fBmemcpy()\fR, \fBmemcmp()\fR, and \fBmemset()\fR functions described on
the \fBmemory\fR(3C) manual page.
.sp
.LP
The \fBbcopy()\fR function copies \fIn\fR bytes from memory area \fIs1\fR
to \fIs2\fR. Copying between objects that overlap will take place
correctly.
.sp
.LP
The \fBbcmp()\fR function compares the first \fIn\fR bytes of its
arguments, returning 0 if they are identical and 1 otherwise. The
\fBbcmp()\fR function always returns 0 when \fIn\fR is 0.
.sp
.LP
The \fBbzero()\fR function sets the first \fIn\fR bytes in memory area
\fIs\fR to 0.
.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
The \fBbcopy()\fR function takes parameters backwards from \fBmemcmp()\fR.
See \fBmemory\fR(3C).
