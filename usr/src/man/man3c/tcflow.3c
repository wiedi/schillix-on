.SH NAME
tcflow \- suspend or restart the transmission or reception of data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>

\fBint\fR \fBtcflow\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR, \fBint\fR \fIaction\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcflow()\fR function suspends transmission or reception of data on
the object referred to by
.IR fildes ,
depending on the value of
.IR action .
The \fIfildes\fR argument is an open file descriptor
associated with a terminal.
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If
.I action
is
.BR TCOOFF ,
output is suspended.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If
.I action
is
.BR TCOON ,
suspended output is restarted.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If
.I action
is
.BR TCIOFF ,
the system transmits a
.BR STOP
character, which is intended to cause the terminal device to stop
transmitting data to the system.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If
.I action
is
.BR TCION ,
the system transmits a
.BR START
character, which is intended to cause the terminal device to start
transmitting data to the system.
.RE
.sp
.LP
The default on the opening of a terminal file is that neither its input nor
its output are suspended.
.sp
.LP
Attempts to use \fBtcflow()\fR from a process which is a member of a
background process group on a \fIfildes\fR associated with its controlling
terminal, will cause the process group to be sent a
.B SIGTTOU
signal. If
the calling process is blocking or ignoring
.B SIGTTOU
signals, the
process is allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B 0
is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is
returned and
.B errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcflow()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EBADF
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The \fIfildes\fR argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINVAL
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The
.I action
argument is not a supported value.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENOTTY
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The file associated with \fIfildes\fR is not a terminal.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBtcflow()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EIO
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt
The process group of the writing process is orphaned, and the writing
process is not ignoring or blocking
.BR SIGTTOU .
