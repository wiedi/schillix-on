.SH NAME
encrypt \- encoding function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <crypt.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBencrypt\fR(\fBchar\fR \fIblock[64]\fR, \fBint\fR \fIedflag\fR);
.fi

.SS "Standard conforming"
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBencrypt\fR(\fBchar\fR \fIblock[64]\fR, \fBint\fR \fIedflag\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B encrypt()
function provides (rather primitive) access to the
hashing algorithm employed by the \fBcrypt\fR(3C) function. The key
generated by
.BR setkey "(3C) is used to encrypt the string"
.I block
with
.BR encrypt() .
.sp
.LP
The
.I block
argument to
.B encrypt()
is an array of length 64 bytes
containing only the bytes with numerical value of 0 and 1. The array is
modified in place to a similar array using the key set by
.BR setkey (3C).
If \fIedflag\fR is 0, the argument is encoded.  If \fIedflag\fR is 1, the
argument may be decoded (see the
.B USAGE
section below); if the argument
is not decoded,
.B errno
will be set to
.BR ENOSYS .
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The
.B encrypt()
function returns no value.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B encrypt()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENOSYS
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The functionality is not supported on this implementation.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
In some environments, decoding may not be implemented.  This is related to
U.S. Government restrictions on encryption and decryption routines: the
.B DES
decryption algorithm cannot be exported outside the U.S.A.
Historical practice has been to ship a different version of the encryption
library without the decryption feature in the routines supplied. Thus the
exported version of
.B encrypt()
does encoding but not decoding.
.sp
.LP
Because
.B encrypt()
does not return a value, applications wishing to
check for errors should set
.B errno
to 0, call
.BR encrypt() ,
then
test
.B errno
and, if it is non-zero, assume an error has occurred.
