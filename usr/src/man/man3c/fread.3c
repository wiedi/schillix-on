.TH fread 3C "24 Jul 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
fread \- binary input
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>

\fBsize_t\fR \fBfread\fR(\fBvoid *\fIptr\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIsize\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fInitems\fR, \fBFILE *\fIstream\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfread()\fR function reads into the array pointed to by
.I ptr
up
to
.I nitems
elements whose size is specified by
.I size
in bytes,
from the stream pointed to by
.IR stream .
.RI "For each object," " size"
calls are made to the \fBfgetc\fR(3C) function and the results stored, in
the order read, in an array of
.B "unsigned char"
exactly overlaying the
object. The file-position indicator for the stream (if defined) is advanced
by the number of bytes successfully read. If an error occurs, the resulting
value of the file-position indicator for the stream is unspecified. If a
partial element is read, its value is unspecified.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfread()\fR function may mark the \fBst_atime\fR field of the file
associated with
.I stream
for update. The
.B st_atime
field will be
marked for update by the first successful execution of \fBfgetc\fR(3C),
\fBfgets\fR(3C), \fBfgetwc\fR(3C), \fBfgetws\fR(3C), \fBfread()\fR,
\fBfscanf\fR(3C), \fBgetc\fR(3C), \fBgetchar\fR(3C), \fBgets\fR(3C), or
\fBscanf\fR(3C) using \fIstream\fR that returns data not supplied by a prior
call to \fBungetc\fR(3C) or \fBungetwc\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBfread()\fR returns the number of elements
successfully read, which is less than
.I nitems
only if a read error or
end-of-file is encountered. If
.I size
or
.I nitems
is 0,
\fBfread()\fR returns 0 and the contents of the array and the state of the
stream remain unchanged.  Otherwise, if a read error occurs, the error
indicator for the stream is set and
.B errno
is set to indicate the
error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBfgetc\fR(3C).
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1\fR Reading from a Stream
.sp
.LP
The following example reads a single element from the \fIfp\fR stream into
the array pointed to by \fIbuf\fR.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
\&...
size_t bytes_read;
char buf[100];
FILE *fp;
\&...
bytes_read = fread(buf, sizeof(buf), 1, fp);
\&...
.fi
.in -2

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBferror()\fR or \fBfeof()\fR functions must be used to distinguish
between an error condition and end-of-file condition. See
\fBferror\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
Because of possible differences in element length and byte ordering, files
written using \fBfwrite\fR(3C) are application-dependent, and possibly
cannot be read using \fBfread()\fR by a different application or by the same
application on a different processor.
