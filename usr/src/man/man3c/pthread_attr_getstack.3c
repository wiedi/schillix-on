.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_attr_getstack()
and
.BR pthread_attr_setstack()
functions, respectively, get and set the thread creation stack attributes
.I stackaddr
and
.I stacksize
in the
.I attr
object.
.sp
.LP
The stack attributes specify the area of storage to be used for the created
thread's stack. The base (lowest addressable byte) of the storage is
.IR stackaddr ,
and the size of the storage is
.I stacksize
bytes. The
.I stacksize
argument must be at least {\fBPTHREAD_STACK_MIN\fR}. The
.I stackaddr
argument must be aligned appropriately to be used as a
stack; for example,
.B pthread_attr_setstack()
might fail with
.B EINVAL
if (\fIstackaddr\fR & 0x7) is not 0. All pages within the stack
described by
.I stackaddr
and
.I stacksize
are both readable and
writable by the thread.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return a 0; otherwise, an error
number is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_attr_getstack()
function stores the stack attribute
values in stackaddr and stacksize if successful.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_attr_setstack()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINVAL
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The value of
.I stacksize
is less than {\fBPTHREAD_STACK_MIN\fR}.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_attr_setstack()
function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EACCES
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The stack page(s) described by
.I stackaddr
and
.I stacksize
are not
both readable and writable by the thread.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINVAL
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The value of
.I stackaddr
does not have proper alignment to be used as a
stack, or (\fIstackaddr\fR +
.IR stacksize )
lacks proper alignment.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
These functions are appropriate for use by applications in an environment
where the stack for a thread must be placed in some particular region of
memory.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
