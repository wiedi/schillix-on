.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_rwlock_wrlock()
function applies a write lock to the
read-write lock referenced by
.IR rwlock .
The calling thread acquires the
write lock if no other thread (reader or writer) holds the read-write lock
.IR rwlock .
Otherwise, the thread blocks until it can acquire the lock.
.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_rwlock_trywrlock()
function applies a write lock like the
.B pthread_rwlock_wrlock()
function, with the exception that the function
fails if any thread currently holds
.I rwlock
(for reading or writing).
.sp
.LP
Writers are favored over readers of the same priority to avoid writer
starvation. See
.BR pthread_rwlock_rdlock (3C).
.sp
.LP
Results are undefined if any of these functions are called with an
uninitialized read-write lock.
.sp
.LP
If a signal is delivered to a thread waiting for a read-write lock for
writing, upon return from the signal handler the thread resumes waiting for
the read-write lock for writing as if it was not interrupted.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, the
.B pthread_rwlock_wrlock()
function returns
.BR 0 .
Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_rwlock_trywrlock()
function returns
.B 0
if the lock for
writing on the read-write lock object referenced by
.I rwlock
is acquired.
Otherwise an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_rwlock_wrlock()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EDEADLK
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
The current thread already owns the read-write lock for writing or reading.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_rwlock_trywrlock()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EBUSY
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
The read-write lock could not be acquired for writing because it was already
locked for reading or writing.
