.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B difftime()
function computes the difference between two calendar
times.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBdifftime()\fR functions returns the difference \fI(time1-time0)\fR
expressed in seconds as a
.BR double .
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The
.B difftime()
function is provided because there are no general
arithmetic properties defined for type
.BR time_t .
