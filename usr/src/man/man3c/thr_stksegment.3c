.TH thr_stksegment 3C "15 Jun 2000" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
thr_stksegment \- get thread stack address and size
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR...[ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <thread.h>
#include <signal.h>

\fBint\fR \fBthr_stksegment\fR(\fBstack_t *\fIss\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBthr_stksegment()\fR function returns, in its \fBstack_t\fR argument,
the address and size of the calling thread's stack.
.sp
.LP
The \fBstack_t\fR structure includes the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
void   *ss_sp
size_t ss_size
int    ss_flags
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
On successful return from \fBthr_stksegment()\fR, \fBss_sp\fR contains the
high address of the caller's stack and \fBss_size\fR contains the size of
the stack in bytes.  The \fBss_flags\fR member is always 0. Note that the
meaning of \fBss_sp\fR is reversed from other uses of \fBstack_t\fR such as
\fBsigaltstack\fR(2) where \fBss_sp\fR is the low address.
.sp
.LP
The stack information provided by \fBthr_stksegment()\fR is typically used
by debuggers, garbage collectors, and similar applications. Most
applications should not require such information.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The  \fBthr_stksegment()\fR function returns  \fB0\fR if the thread stack
address and size were successfully retrieved.  Otherwise, it returns a
non-zero error value.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBthr_stksegment()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEAGAIN\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
The stack information for the thread is not available because the thread's
initialization is not yet complete, or the thread is an internal thread.
