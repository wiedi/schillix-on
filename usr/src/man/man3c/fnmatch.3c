.TH fnmatch 3C "24 Jul 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
fnmatch \- match filename or path name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <fnmatch.h>

\fBint\fR \fBfnmatch\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIpattern\fR, \fBconst char *\fR\fIstring\fR, \fBint\fR \fIflags\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfnmatch()\fR function matches patterns as described on the \fBfnmatch\fR(5) manual page.  It checks the \fIstring\fR argument to see if it matches the \fIpattern\fR argument.
.sp
.LP
The \fIflags\fR argument modifies the interpretation of \fIpattern\fR and \fIstring\fR. It is the bitwise inclusive \fBOR\fR of zero or more of the following flags defined in the header <\fBfnmatch.h\fR>.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBFNM_PATHNAME\fR  \fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
If set, a slash (\fB/\fR) character in \fIstring\fR will be explicitly matched by a slash in \fIpattern\fR; it will not be matched by either the asterisk (\fB*\fR) or question-mark (\fB?\fR) special characters, nor by a bracket (\fB[\|]\fR) expression.
.sp
If not set, the slash character is treated as an ordinary character.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBFNM_NOESCAPE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
If not set, a backslash character (\fB\e\fR) in \fIpattern\fR followed by any other character will match that second character in \fIstring\fR. In particular, "\fB\e\e\fR" will match a backslash in \fIstring\fR.
.sp
If set, a backslash character will be treated as an ordinary character.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBFNM_PERIOD\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
If set, a leading period in \fIstring\fR will match a period in \fIpattern\fR; where the location of "leading" is indicated by the value of \fBFNM_PATHNAME\fR: 
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If \fBFNM_PATHNAME\fR is set, a period is "leading" if it is the first character in \fIstring\fR or if it immediately follows a slash.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If \fBFNM_PATHNAME\fR is not set, a period is "leading" only if it is the first character of \fIstring\fR.
.RE
.RE

.sp
.LP
If not set, no special restrictions are placed on matching a period.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If \fIstring\fR matches the pattern specified by \fIpattern\fR, then \fBfnmatch()\fR returns \fB0\fR. If there is no match, \fBfnmatch()\fR returns \fBFNM_NOMATCH\fR, which is defined in the header <\fBfnmatch.h\fR>. If an error occurs, \fBfnmatch()\fR returns another non-zero value.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBfnmatch()\fR function has two major uses. It could be used by an application or utility that needs to read a directory and apply a pattern against each entry. The \fBfind\fR(1) utility is an example of this. It can also be used by the \fBpax\fR(1) utility to process its \fIpattern\fR operands, or by applications that need to match strings in a similar manner.
.sp
.LP
The name \fBfnmatch()\fR is intended to imply \fIfilename\fR match, rather than \fIpathname\fR match. The default action of this function is to match filenames, rather than path names, since it gives no special significance to the slash character. With the \fBFNM_PATHNAME\fR flag, \fBfnmatch()\fR does match path names, but without tilde expansion, parameter expansion, or special treatment for period at the beginning of a filename.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfnmatch()\fR function can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale.
