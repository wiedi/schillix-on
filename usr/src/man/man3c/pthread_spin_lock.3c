.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_spin_lock()
function locks the spin lock referenced by
.IR lock .
The calling thread acquires the lock if it is not held by
another thread. Otherwise, the thread spins (that is, does not return from
the
.BR "pthread_spin_lock call()" )
until the lock becomes available. The
results are undefined if the calling thread holds the lock at the time the
call is made.
.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_spin_trylock()
function locks the spin lock referenced by
.I lock
if it is not held by any thread. Otherwise, the function fails.
.sp
.LP
The results are undefined if either of these functions is called with an
uninitialized spin lock.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions returns 0. Otherwise, an error
number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_spin_trylock()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EBUSY
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
A thread currently holds the lock.
.RE

.sp
.LP
These functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINVAL
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The value specified by
.I lock
does not refer to an initialized spin
lock object.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_spin_lock()
function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EDEADLK
.ad
.RS 11n
