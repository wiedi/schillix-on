.TH setkey 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
setkey \- set encoding key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBsetkey\fR(\fBconst char *\fIkey\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B setkey()
function provides (rather primitive) access to the
hashing algorithm employed by the \fBcrypt\fR(3C) function. The argument of
.B setkey()
is an array of length 64 bytes containing only the bytes with
numerical value of 0 and 1. If this string is divided into groups of 8, the
low-order bit in each group is ignored; this gives a 56-bit key which is
used by the algorithm. This is the key that will be used with the algorithm
to encode a string
.I block
passed to
.BR encrypt (3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
No values are returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B setkey()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENOSYS
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The functionality is not supported on this implementation.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
In some environments, decoding may not be implemented.  This is related to
U.S. Government restrictions on encryption and decryption routines: the
.B DES
decryption algorithm cannot be exported outside the U.S.A.
Historical practice has been to ship a different version of the encryption
library without the decryption feature in the routines supplied. Thus the
exported version of
.B encrypt()
does encoding but not decoding.
.sp
.LP
Because
.B setkey()
does not return a value, applications wishing to
check for errors should set
.B errno
to 0, call
.BR setkey() ,
then test
.B errno
and, if it is non-zero, assume an error has occurred.
