.SH NAME
wcrtomb \- convert a wide-character code to a character (restartable)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>

\fBsize_t\fR \fBwcrtomb\fR(\fBchar *restrict\fR \fIs\fR, \fBwchar_t\fR \fIwc\fR, \fBmbstate_t *restrict\fR \fIps\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
If \fIs\fR is a null pointer, the \fBwcrtomb()\fR function is equivalent to
the call:
.sp
.LP
wcrtomb(buf, L'\e0', ps)
.sp
.LP
where \fIbuf\fR is an internal buffer.
.sp
.LP
If \fIs\fR is not a null pointer, the \fBwcrtomb()\fR function determines
the number of bytes needed to represent the character that corresponds to
the wide-character given by \fIwc\fR (including any shift sequences), and
stores the resulting bytes in the array whose first element is pointed to by
\fIs\fR. At most \fBMB_CUR_MAX\fR bytes are stored.  If \fIwc\fR is a null
wide-character, a null byte is stored, preceded by any shift sequence needed
to restore the initial shift state. The resulting state described is the
initial conversion state.
.sp
.LP
If \fIps\fR is a null pointer, the \fBwcrtomb()\fR function uses its own
internal \fBmbstate_t\fR object, which is initialized at program startup to
the initial conversion state.   Otherwise, the  \fBmbstate_t\fR object
pointed to by \fIps\fR is used to completely describe the current conversion
state of the associated character sequence. Solaris will behave as if no
function defined in the Solaris Reference Manual calls \fBwcrtomb()\fR.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of this function is affected by the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of
the current locale.  See \fBenviron\fR(5).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcrtomb()\fR function returns the number of bytes stored in the
array object (including any shift sequences).  When \fIwc\fR is not a valid
wide-character, an encoding error occurs.  In this case, the function stores
the value of the macros \fBEILSEQ\fR in \fBerrno\fR and returns
\fB(size_t)\(mi1\fR; the conversion state is undefined.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcrtomb()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEINVAL\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The \fIps\fR argument points to an object that contains an invalid
conversion state.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEILSEQ\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Invalid wide-character code is detected.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
If \fIps\fR is not a null pointer, \fBwcrtomb()\fR uses the \fBmbstate_t\fR
object pointed to by \fIps\fR and the function can be used safely in
multithreaded applications, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being
called to change the locale. If \fIps\fR is a null pointer, \fBwcrtomb()\fR
uses its internal \fBmbstate_t\fR object and the function is Unsafe in
multithreaded applications.
