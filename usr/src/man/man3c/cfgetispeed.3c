.SH NAME
cfgetispeed, cfgetospeed \- get input and output baud rate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>

\fBspeed_t\fR \fBcfgetispeed\fR(\fBconst struct termios *\fItermios_p\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBspeed_t\fR \fBcfgetospeed\fR(\fBconst struct termios *\fItermios_p\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcfgetispeed()\fR function extracts the input baud rate from the
\fBtermios\fR structure to which the \fItermios_p\fR argument points.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcfgetospeed()\fR function extracts the output baud rate from the
\fBtermios\fR structure to which the \fItermios_p\fR argument points.
.sp
.LP
These functions returns exactly the value in the
.B termios
data
structure, without interpretation.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBcfgetispeed()\fR returns a value of type
\fBspeed_t\fR representing the input baud rate.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBcfgetospeed()\fR returns a value of type
\fBspeed_t\fR representing the output baud rate.
