.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B wcstol()
and
.B wcstoll()
functions convert the initial
portion of the wide character string pointed to by
.I nptr
to
.BR long
and
.B "long long"
representation, respectively. They first decompose the
input string into three parts:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
an initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space wide-character codes
(as specified by
.BR iswspace (3C))
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
a subject sequence interpreted as an integer represented in some radix
determined by the value of
.IR base
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
a final wide character string of one or more unrecognised wide character
codes, including the terminating null wide-character code of the input wide
character string
.RE
.sp
.LP
They then attempt to convert the subject sequence to an integer, and return
the result.
.sp
.LP
If the value of
.I base
is
.BR 0 ,
the expected form of the subject
sequence is that of a decimal constant, octal constant or hexadecimal
constant, any of which may be preceded by a `+' or `\(mi' sign. A decimal
constant begins with a non-zero digit, and consists of a sequence of decimal
digits. An octal constant consists of the prefix `0' optionally followed by
a sequence of the digits `0' to `7' only. A hexadecimal constant consists of
the prefix `0x' or `0X' followed by a sequence of the decimal digits and
letters `a' (or `A') to `f' (or `F') with values 10 to 15 respectively.
.sp
.LP
If the value of
.I base
is between
.B 2
and
.BR 36 ,
the expected
form of the subject sequence is a sequence of letters and digits
representing an integer with the radix specified by
.IR base ,
optionally
preceded by a `+' or `\(mi' sign, but not including an integer suffix. The
letters from `a' (or `A') to `z' (or `Z') inclusive  are ascribed the values
10 to 35; only letters whose ascribed values are less than that of
\fIbase\fR are permitted. If the value of \fIbase\fR is
.BR 16 ,
the
wide-character code representations of `0x' or `0X' may optionally precede
the sequence of letters and digits, following the sign if present.
.sp
.LP
The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of the
input wide character string, starting with the first non-white-space
wide-character code, that is of the expected form. The subject sequence
contains no wide-character codes if the input wide character string is empty
or consists entirely of white-space wide-character code, or if the first
non-white-space wide-character code is other than a sign or a permissible
letter or digit.
.sp
.LP
If the subject sequence has the expected form and the value of
.IR base
is
.BR 0 ,
the sequence of wide-character codes starting with the first
digit is interpreted as an integer constant. If the subject sequence has the
expected form and the value of
.I base
is between
.B 2
and
.BR 36 ,
it is used as the base for conversion, ascribing to each letter its value as
given above. If the subject sequence begins with a minus sign (-), the value
resulting from the conversion is negated. A pointer to the final wide
character string is stored  in the object pointed to by
.IR endptr ,
provided that
.I endptr
is not a null pointer.
.sp
.LP
If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no
conversion is performed; the value of
.I nptr
is stored in the object
pointed to by
.IR endptr ,
provided that
.I endptr
is not a null
pointer.
.sp
.LP
These functions do not change the setting of
.B errno
if successful.
.sp
.LP
Since 0, {\fBLONG_MIN\fR} or {\fBLLONG_MIN\fR}, and {\fBLONG_MAX\fR} or
{\fBLLONG_MAX\fR} are returned on error and are also valid returns on
success, an application wanting to check for error situations should set
\fBerrno\fR to 0, call one of these functions, then check
.BR errno .
.sp
.LP
The
.B wstol()
function is equivalent to
.BR wcstol() .
.sp
.LP
The
.B watol()
function is equivalent to
\fBwstol(\fIstr\fB,(wchar_t **)NULL, 10)\fI\&.\fR
.sp
.LP
The
.B watoll()
function is the long-long (double long) version of
.BR watol() .
.sp
.LP
The
.B watoi()
function is equivalent to
.BR (int)watol(\|) .
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return the converted value, if
any. If no conversion could be performed, 0 is returned and
.B errno
may
be set to indicate the error. If the correct value is outside the range of
representable values, {\fBLONG_MIN\fR}, {\fBLONG_MAX\fR}, {\fBLLONG_MIN\fR},
or {\fBLLONG_MAX\fR} is returned (according to the sign of the value), and
\fBerrno\fR is set to
.BR ERANGE .
