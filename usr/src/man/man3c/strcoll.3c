.TH strcoll 3C "1 Nov 2003" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
strcoll \- string collation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <string.h>

\fBint\fR \fBstrcoll\fR(\fBconst char *\fIs1\fR, \fBconst char *\fIs2\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Both
.B strcoll()
and \fBstrxfrm\fR(3C) provide for locale-specific
string sorting. 
.B strcoll()
is intended for applications in which the
number of comparisons per string is small. When strings are to be compared a
number of times, \fBstrxfrm\fR(3C) is a more appropriate function because
the transformation process occurs only once.
.sp
.LP
The
.B strcoll()
function does not change the setting of
.B errno
if
successful.
.sp
.LP
Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an application
wishing to check for error situations should set
.B errno
to 0, then call
.BR strcoll() ,
then check
.BR errno .
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B strcoll()
returns an integer greater
than, equal to, or less than zero in direct correlation to whether string
\fIs1\fR is greater than, equal to, or less than the string
.IR s2 .
The
comparison is based on strings interpreted as appropriate to the program's
locale for category
.B LC_COLLATE
(see \fBsetlocale\fR(3C)).
.sp
.LP
On error,
.B strcoll()
may set
.BR errno ,
but no return value is
reserved to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B strcoll()
function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINVAL
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The
.I s1
or
.I s2
arguments contain characters outside the domain of
the collating sequence.

The

applications, as long as
.BR setlocale (3C)
is not being called to change
the locale.
