.TH nl_langinfo 3C "24 Jul 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
nl_langinfo \- language information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <langinfo.h>

\fBchar *\fBnl_langinfo\fR(\fBnl_item\fR \fIitem\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnl_langinfo()\fR function returns a pointer to a null-terminated
string containing information relevant to a particular language or cultural
area defined in the programs locale. The manifest constant names and values
of
.I item
are defined by <\fBlanginfo.h\fR>. For example:
.sp
.LP
\fBnl_langinfo (ABDAY_1);\fR
.sp
.LP
would return a pointer to the string "\fBDim\fR" if the identified language
was French and a French locale was correctly installed; or "\fBSun\fR" if
the identified language was English.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) has not been called successfully, or if  data for a
supported language is either not available, or if
.I item
is not defined
therein, then \fBnl_langinfo()\fR returns a pointer to the corresponding
string in the C locale. In all locales,  \fBnl_langinfo()\fR returns a
pointer to an empty string if
.I item
contains an invalid setting.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBnl_langinfo()\fR function can be used safely in multithreaded
applications, as long as
.BR setlocale (3C)
is not being called to change
the locale.
