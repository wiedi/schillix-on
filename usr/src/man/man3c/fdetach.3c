.TH fdetach 3C "24 Jul 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
fdetach \- detach a name from a STREAMS-based file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stropts.h>

\fBint\fR \fBfdetach\fR(\fBconst char *\fIpath\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfdetach()\fR function detaches a STREAMS-based file from the file to
which it was attached by a previous call to \fBfattach\fR(3C). The
\fIpath\fR argument points to the pathname of the attached \fBSTREAMS\fR
file. The process must have appropriate privileges or be the owner of the
file. A successful call to \fBfdetach()\fR causes all pathnames that named
the attached
.B STREAMS
file to again name the file to which the
\fBSTREAMS\fR file was attached.  All subsequent operations on \fIpath\fR
will operate on the underlying file and not on the
.B STREAMS
file.
.sp
.LP
All open file descriptions established while the
.B STREAMS
file was
attached to the file referenced by
.IR path ,
will still refer to the
\fBSTREAMS\fR file after the \fBfdetach()\fR has taken effect.
.sp
.LP
If there are no open file descriptors or other references to the
\fBSTREAMS\fR file, then a successful call to \fBfdetach()\fR has the same
effect as performing the last
.BR close (2)
on the attached file.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBfdetach()\fR returns
.BR 0 .
Otherwise, it
returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets
.B errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
