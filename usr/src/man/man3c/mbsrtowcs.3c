.TH mbsrtowcs 3C "1 Nov 2003" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
mbsrtowcs \- convert a character string to a wide-character string
(restartable)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>

\fBsize_t\fR \fBmbsrtowcs\fR(\fBwchar_t *restrict\fR \fIdst\fR, \fBconst char **restrict\fR \fIsrc\fR,
     \fBsize_t\fR \fIlen\fR, \fBmbstate_t *restrict\fR \fIps\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmbsrtowcs()\fR function converts a sequence of characters, beginning
in the conversion state described by the object pointed to by \fIps\fR, from
the array indirectly pointed to by \fIsrc\fR into a sequence of
corresponding wide-characters. If \fIdst\fR is not a null pointer, the
converted characters are stored into the array pointed to by  \fIdst\fR.
Conversion continues up to and including a terminating null character, which
is also stored.  Conversion stops early in either of the following cases:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
When a sequence of bytes is encountered that does not form a valid
character.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
When \fIlen\fR codes have been stored into the array pointed to by
\fIdst\fR (and  \fIdst\fR is not a null pointer).
.RE
.sp
.LP
Each conversion takes place as if by a call to the \fBmbrtowc()\fR
function.
.sp
.LP
If \fIdst\fR is not a null pointer, the pointer object pointed to by
\fIsrc\fR is assigned either a null pointer (if conversion stopped due to
reaching a terminating null character) or the address just past the last
character converted (if any).  If conversion stopped due to reaching a
terminating null character, and if \fIdst\fR is not a null pointer, the
resulting state described is the initial conversion state.
.sp
.LP
If \fIps\fR is a null pointer, the \fBmbsrtowcs()\fR function uses its own
internal \fBmbstate_t\fR object, which is initialized at program startup to
the initial conversion state.  Otherwise, the  \fBmbstate_t\fR object
pointed to by \fIps\fR is used to completely describe the current conversion
state of the associated character sequence. Solaris will behave as if no
function defined in the Solaris Reference Manual calls \fBmbsrtowcs()\fR.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of this function is affected by the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of
the current locale.  See \fBenviron\fR(5).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If the input conversion encounters a sequence of bytes that do not form a
valid character, an encoding error occurs.  In this case, the
\fBmbsrtowcs()\fR function stores the value of the macro \fBEILSEQ\fR in
\fBerrno\fR and returns \fB(size_t)\(mi1\fR; the conversion state is
undefined. Otherwise, it returns the number of characters successfully
converted, not including the terminating null (if any).
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBmbsrtowcs()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEINVAL\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The \fIps\fR argument points to an object that contains an invalid
conversion state.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBEILSEQ\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
Invalid character sequence is detected.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If \fIps\fR is not a null pointer, \fBmbsrtowcs()\fR uses the
\fBmbstate_t\fR object pointed to by \fIps\fR and the function can be used
safely in multithreaded applications, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not
being called to change the locale. If \fIps\fR is a null pointer,
\fBmbsrtowcs()\fR uses its internal \fBmbstate_t\fR object and the function
is Unsafe in multithreaded applications.
