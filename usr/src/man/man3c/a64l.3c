.SH NAME
a64l, l64a \- convert between long integer and base-64 ASCII string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>

\fBlong\fR \fBa64l\fR(\fBconst char *\fIs\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBchar *\fBl64a\fR(\fBlong\fR \fIl\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions maintain numbers stored in base-64
.B ASCII
characters
that define a notation by which long integers can be represented by up to
six characters. Each character represents a "digit" in a radix-64
notation.
.sp
.LP
The characters used to represent "digits" are as follows:
.sp

lw(2.76i) |lw(2.74i)
lw(2.76i) |lw(2.74i)

.sp
.LP
The
.B a64l()
function takes a pointer to a null-terminated base-64
representation and returns a corresponding
.B long
value.  If the string
pointed to by
.I s
contains more than six characters,
.B a64l()
uses
the first six.
.sp
.LP
The
.B a64l()
function scans the character string from left to right
with the least significant digit on the left, decoding each character as a
6-bit radix-64 number.
.sp
.LP
The
.B l64a()
function takes a
.B long
argument and returns a pointer
to the corresponding base-64 representation. If the argument is 0,
.B l64a()
returns a pointer to a null string.
.sp
.LP
The value returned by
.B l64a()
is a pointer into a static buffer, the
contents of which are overwritten by each call.  In the case of
multithreaded applications, the return value is a pointer to thread specific
data.
