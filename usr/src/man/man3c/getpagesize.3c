.SH NAME
getpagesize \- get system page size
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBint\fR \fBgetpagesize\fR(\fBvoid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B getpagesize()
function returns the number of bytes in a page.
Page granularity is the granularity of many of the memory management
calls.
.sp
.LP
The page size is a system page size and need not be the same as the
underlying hardware page size.
.sp
.LP
The
.B getpagesize()
function is equivalent to
\fBsysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE)\fR and
.BR sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) .
See
.BR sysconf (3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The
.B getpagesize()
function returns the current page size.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The value returned by
.B getpagesize()
need not be the minimum value
that
.BR malloc "(3C) can allocate.  Moreover, the application cannot assume"
that an object of this size can be allocated with
.BR malloc() .
