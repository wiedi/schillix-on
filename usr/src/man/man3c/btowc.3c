.TH btowc 3C "24 Jul 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
btowc \- single-byte to wide-character conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>

\fBwint_t\fR \fBbtowc\fR(\fBint\fR \fIc\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBbtowc()\fR function determines whether \fIc\fR constitutes a valid
(one-byte) character in the initial shift state.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of this function is affected by the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of
the current locale.  See \fBenviron\fR(5).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBbtowc()\fR function returns \fBWEOF\fR if \fIc\fR has the value
\fBEOF\fR or if  \fB(unsigned char)\fR\fIc\fR does not constitute a valid
(one-byte) character in the initial shift state.  Otherwise, it returns the
wide-character representation of that character.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH ATTRIBUTES

.SH NOTES

.LP
The \fBbtowc()\fR function can be used safely in multithreaded
applications, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change
the locale.
