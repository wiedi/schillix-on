.SH NAME
pthread_mutexattr_getpshared, pthread_mutexattr_setpshared \- get or set
process-shared attribute
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_mutexattr_getpshared\fR(

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_mutexattr_getpshared()
function obtains the value of the
\fIprocess-shared\fR attribute from the attributes object referenced by
.IR attr .
The
.B pthread_mutexattr_setpshared()
function is used to set
the
.I process-shared
attribute in an initialized attributes object
referenced by
.IR attr .
.sp
.LP
The
.I process-shared
attribute is set to 
.BR PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED
to permit a mutex to be operated upon by any thread that has access to the
memory where the mutex is allocated, even if the mutex is allocated in
memory that is shared by multiple processes. If the \fIprocess-shared\fR
attribute is
.BR PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE ,
the mutex will only be operated
upon by threads created within the same process as the thread that
initialized the mutex; if threads of differing processes attempt to operate
on such a mutex, the behavior is undefined. The default value of the
attribute is
.BR PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE .
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B pthread_mutexattr_getpshared()
returns
\fB0\fR and stores the value of the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute of
\fIattr\fR into the object referenced by the \fIpshared\fR parameter.
Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B pthread_mutexattr_setpshared()
returns
.BR 0 .
Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
