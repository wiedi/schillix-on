.TH initgroups 3C "22 Mar 2004" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
initgroups \- initialize the supplementary group access list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <grp.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

\fBint\fR \fBinitgroups\fR(\fBconst char *\fIname\fR, \fBgid_t\fR \fIbasegid\fR);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B initgroups()
function reads the group database to get the group
membership for the user specified by
.IR name ,
and initializes the
supplementary group access list of the calling process (see
.BR getgrnam (3C)
and
.BR getgroups (2)).
The
.I basegid
group ID is
also included in the supplementary group access list. This is typically the
real group ID from the user database.
.sp
.LP
While scanning the group database, if the number of groups, including the
\fIbasegid\fR entry, exceeds
.BR NGROUPS_MAX ,
subsequent group entries are
ignored.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, \(mi1 is returned and
\fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B initgroups()
function will fail and not change the supplementary
group access list if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EPERM
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
The {\fBPRIV_PROC_SETID\fR} privilege is not asserted in the effective set
of the calling process.
