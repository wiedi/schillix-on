.LP
.nf
\fBsize_t\fR \fBwcsftime\fR(\fBwchar_t *\fIwcs\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fImaxsize\fR, \fBconst char *\fIformat\fR,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcsftime()\fR function is equivalent to the \fBstrftime\fR(3C)
function, except that:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The argument
.I wcs
points to the initial element of an array of
wide-characters into which the generated output is to be placed.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The argument
.I maxsize
indicates the maximum number of wide-characters
to be placed in the output array.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The argument \fIformat\fR is a wide-character string and the conversion
specifications are  replaced by corresponding sequences of
wide-characters.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The return value indicates the number of wide-characters placed in the
output array.
.RE
.sp
.LP
If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If the total number of resulting wide character  codes (including the
terminating null wide-character code) is no more than
.IR maxsize ,
\fBwcsftime()\fR returns the number of wide-character codes  placed into the
array pointed to by
.IR wcs ,
not including the terminating null
wide-character code. Otherwise,
.B 0
is returned and the contents of the
array are indeterminate.
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcfstime()\fR function uses
.BR malloc (3C)
and should
\fBmalloc()\fR fail, \fBerrno\fR will be set by \fBmalloc()\fR.

.SH NOTES

.LP
The \fBwcsftime()\fR function can be used safely in multithreaded
applications, as long as
.BR setlocale (3C)
is not being called to change
the locale.
