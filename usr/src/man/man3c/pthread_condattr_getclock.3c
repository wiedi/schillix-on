.SH NAME
pthread_condattr_getclock, pthread_condattr_setclock \- get and set the
clock selection condition variable attribute
.SH SYNOPSIS

cc \fB-mt\fR [ \fIflag\fR.\|.\|. ] \fIfile\fR.\|.\|. [ \fIlibrary\fR.\|.\|. ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_condattr_getclock\fR(
     \fBconst pthread_condattr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBclockid_t *restrict\fR \fIclock_id\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf

      \fBclockid_t\fR \fIclock_id\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B pthread_condattr_getclock()
function obtains the value of the
clock attribute from the attributes object referenced by
.IR attr .
The
\fBpthread_condattr_setclock()\fR function sets the clock attribute in an
initialized attributes object referenced by
.IR attr .
If
\fBpthread_condattr_setclock()\fR is called with a \fIclock_id\fR argument
that refers to a CPU-time clock, the call fails.
.sp
.LP
The clock attribute is the clock ID of the clock that is used to measure
the timeout service of \fBpthread_cond_timedwait\fR(3C). The default value
of the clock attribute refers to the system clock.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the
.B pthread_condattr_getclock()
function
returns 0 and stores the value of the clock attribute of
.I attr
into the
object referenced by the
.I clock_id
argument. Otherwise, an error number
is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the
.B pthread_condattr_setclock()
function
returns 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
These functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINVAL
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The value specified by
.I attr
is invalid.
