.SH NAME
fclose \- close a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>

\fBint\fR \fBfclose\fR(\fBFILE *\fIstream\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfclose()\fR function causes the stream pointed to by
.I stream
to
be flushed and the associated file to be closed. Any unwritten buffered data
for the stream is written to the file; any unread buffered data is
discarded. The stream is disassociated from the file. If the associated
buffer was automatically allocated, it is deallocated.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfclose()\fR function marks for update the
.B st_ctime
and
\fBst_mtime\fR fields of the underlying file if the stream is writable and
if buffered data has not yet been written to the file.  It will perform a
.BR close (2)
operation on the file descriptor that is associated with the
stream pointed to by
.IR stream .
.sp
.LP
After the call to
.BR fclose() ,
any use of
.I stream
causes undefined
behavior.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfclose()\fR function is performed automatically for all open files
upon calling
.BR exit (2).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBfclose()\fR returns
.BR 0 .
Otherwise, it
returns
.B EOF
and sets
.B errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBfclose()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EAGAIN
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The
.B O_NONBLOCK
flag is set for the file descriptor underlying
\fIstream\fR and the process would be delayed in the write operation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EBADF
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The file descriptor underlying stream is not valid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EFBIG
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the maximum file size or
the process's file size limit; or the file is a regular file and an attempt
was made to write at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the
corresponding stream.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINTR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The \fBfclose()\fR function was interrupted by a signal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EIO
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
The process is a member of a background process group attempting to write
to its controlling terminal,
.B TOSTOP
is set, the process is neither
ignoring nor blocking
.B SIGTTOU
and the process group of the process is
orphaned.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENOSPC
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
There was no free space remaining on the device containing the file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EPIPE
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt
An attempt is made to write to a pipe or
.B FIFO
that is not open for
reading by any process. A
.B SIGPIPE
signal will also be sent to the
calling thread.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBfclose()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENXIO
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt
A request was made of a non-existent device, or the request was beyond the
limits of the device.
