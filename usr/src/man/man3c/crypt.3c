.SH NAME
crypt \- string encoding function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <crypt.h>

\fBchar *\fBcrypt\fR(\fBconst char *\fIkey\fR, \fBconst char *\fIsalt\fR);
.fi

.SS "Standard conforming"
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBchar *\fBcrypt\fR(\fBconst char *\fIkey\fR, \fBconst char *\fIsalt\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B crypt()
function encodes strings suitable for secure storage as
passwords. It generates the password hash given the
.I key
and
.IR salt .
.sp
.LP
The
.I key
argument is the plain text password to be encrypted.
.sp
.LP
If the first character of \fIsalt\fR is "$", \fBcrypt()\fR uses
.BR crypt.conf (4)
to determine which shared module to load for the
encryption algorithm.  The algorithm name
.B crypt()
uses to search in
\fBcrypt.conf\fR is the string between the first and second "$", or between
the first "$" and first "," if a "," comes before the second "$".
.sp
.LP
If the first character of \fIsalt\fR is not "$", the algorithm described on
.BR crypt_unix (5)
is used.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B crypt()
returns a pointer to the encoded
string. Otherwise it returns a null pointer and sets
.B errno
to indicate
the error.
.sp
.LP
The return value points to static data that is overwritten by each call.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The
.B crypt()
function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EINVAL
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
An entry in
.B crypt.conf
is invalid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ELIBACC
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
The required shared library was not found.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENOMEM
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
There is insufficient memory to generate the hash.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B ENOSYS
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt
The functionality is not supported on this system.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The values returned by this function might not be portable among
standard-conforming systems. See
.BR standards (5).
.sp
.LP
Applications should not use
.B crypt()
to store or verify user passwords
but should use the functions described on
.BR pam "(3PAM) instead."
