.SH NAME
tcflush \- flush non-transmitted output data, non-read input data or both
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>

\fBint\fR \fBtcflush\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR, \fBint\fR \fIqueue_selector\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBtcflush()\fR discards data written to the
object referred to by \fIfildes\fR (an open file descriptor associated with
a terminal) but not transmitted, or data received but not read, depending on
the value of
.IR queue_selector :
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If
.I queue_selector
is
.B TCIFLUSH
it flushes data received but not
read.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If
.I queue_selector
is
.B TCOFLUSH
it flushes data written but not
transmitted.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If
.I queue_selector
is
.B TCIOFLUSH
it flushes both data received
but not read and data written but not transmitted.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Attempts to use \fBtcflush()\fR from a process which is a member of a
background process group on a \fIfildes\fR associated with its controlling
terminal, will cause the process group to be sent a
.B SIGTTOU
signal. If
the calling process is blocking or ignoring
.B SIGTTOU
signals, the
process is allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,
.B 0
is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is
returned and
.B errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcflush()\fR function will fail if:
.sp

.LP
The \fBtcflush()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B EIO
.ad
.RS 7n

process is not ignoring or blocking
