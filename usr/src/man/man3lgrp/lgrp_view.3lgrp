.SH NAME
lgrp_view \- get view of lgroup hierarchy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc [ \fIflag \&.\|.\|.\fR ] \fIfile\fR\&.\|.\|. \fB-llgrp\fR [ \fIlibrary \&.\|.\|.\fR ]
#include <sys/lgrp_user.h>

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlgrp_view()\fR function takes a \fIcookie\fR representing the
snapshot of the lgroup hierarchy obtained from \fBlgrp_init\fR(3LGRP) and
returns the snapshot's view of the lgroup hierarchy.
.sp
.LP
If the given view is \fBLGRP_VIEW_CALLER\fR, the snapshot contains only the
resources that are available to the caller (such as those with respect to
processor sets).  When the view is \fBLGRP_VIEW_OS\fR, the snapshot contains
what is available to the operating system.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon succesful completion, \fBlgrp_view()\fR returns the view for the
snapshot of the lgroup hierarchy represented by the given cookie.
Otherwise, \(mi1 is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBlgrp_view()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
