 * The structure below describes an enumerator.  Enumerators are
 * chunks of code either built-in to or loaded by the library to
 * search for and enumerate items in the hardware topology.  They
 * currently have just three entry points, initialize and finish entry
 * points te_init() and te_fini() and then the actual enumeration
 * function te_enum().  The te_init() routine will be called exactly
 * once, the first time that libtopo needs to use the enumerator.  If
 * initialization of the enumerator fails, the te_init() function
 * should return a value of TE_INITFAIL, else it should return
 * TE_INITOK.  The te_fini() routine will also be called exactly once,
 * when libtopo shuts down.  The te_enum() routine may be called
 * multiple times to request enumeration at various points in the
 * topology.
 *
 * An enumerator is required to have an _enum_init() function that
 * libtopo will call when the enumerator is initially loaded.  The
 * function is expected to return a pointer to a struct tenumr.
