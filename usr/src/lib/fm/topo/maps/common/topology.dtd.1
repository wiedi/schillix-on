  Topology description DTD

    Most attributes are string values (or an individual string from a
    restricted set), but attributes with a specific type requirement are
    noted in the comment describing the element.

<!--
  XInclude support

    Topologies may be composed via the xi:include tag.
    libtopo(3LIB) interfaces enforce that all composed topologies be of the
    same scheme.

<!-- Methods -->

<!--
  enum-method

    This element describes the enumeration method used to
    populate a composition of topo nodes.  Its interpretation is
    left to the enumerator to which a particular topo node is
    assigned.  It contains a set of attributes, context, and an optional
    stability element for the optional args that can be included.

    Its attributes are

	name	Name of this method.  The method names are
		usually a defined interface of the enumerator to which a
		topo instance assigned.

	version Version of the enumeration API

<!--
  node

    This element identifies a known topology node.

    Its attributes are

	instance The instance number of the known node

	static	Boolean to determine if node is statically created
		by the XML parser or an enumerator

	min	The smallest allowed instance number for an
		actual topo node.

	max	The largest allowed instance number for an
		actual topo node.
