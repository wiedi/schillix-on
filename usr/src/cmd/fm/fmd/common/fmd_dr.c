/*
 * FMD Dynamic Reconfiguration (DR) Event Handling
 *
 * Fault manager scheme plug-ins must track characteristics of individual
 * pieces of hardware.  As these components can be added or removed by a DR
 * operation, we need to provide a means by which plug-ins can determine when
 * they need to re-examine the current configuration.  We provide a simple
 * mechanism whereby this task can be implemented using lazy evaluation: a
 * simple 64-bit generation counter is maintained and incremented on *any* DR.
 * Schemes can store the generation number in scheme-specific data structures,
 * and then revalidate their contents if the current generation number has
 * changed since the resource information was cached.  This method saves time,
 * avoids the complexity of direct participation in DR, avoids the need for
 * resource-specific processing of DR events, and is relatively easy to port
 * to other systems that support dynamic reconfiguration.
