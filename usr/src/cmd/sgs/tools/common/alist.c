 * Alist manipulation.  An Alist is a list of elements formed into an array.
 * Traversal of the list is an array scan, which because of the locality of
 * each reference is probably more efficient than a link-list traversal.
 *
 * The elements of an Alist are variable length.  They can be pointers to
 * other data structures, or data structures themselves.  Traversal of an Alist
 * thus returns a pointer to each data element.
 *
 * Alist elements can be deleted.  This involve sliding any following elements
 * over the element being deleted.  ALIST_TRAVERSE() may be employed to traverse
 * the list, at the same time elements are being deleted.  Therefore, the next
 * element is always determined as an offset from the beginning of the list.
